Feature: Sprint 2 Task

  Overview

  The Audience team is working on a project that will allow writers in the news rooms to send a single story out immediately as breaking news via email and push notifications without leaving CUE. CUE is an interface where writers create, edit and publish their stories to their respective  publication.
  To support this project, there needs to be an investigation on what is the best way for  the Audience team to create and receive push notifications and the respective functionality (eg. deeplinking..etc) in an app without impacting mobile development and testing

  The output is a document that outlines possible approaches to handle this situation that will be reviewed by Dev, QA and Product.
