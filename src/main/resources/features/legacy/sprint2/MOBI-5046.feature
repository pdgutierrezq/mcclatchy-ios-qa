Feature: Sprint 2 Task

  *Overview:* Investigate whether all of the Apple dialogs that display, as part of MPP, can be tagged and tracked in Omniture.

  *Output:* If all of the Apple dialogs that display, as part of MPP, can be tagged and tracked in Omniture then add a comment in this ticket indicating as such. If this can not be done for all of the Apple dialogs then create a document and clearly note for each Apple dialog which  can and can not be tagged and tracked in Omniture and why and outline possible workarounds for those that can't be readily tracked so that they can reviewed by Product and Dev
