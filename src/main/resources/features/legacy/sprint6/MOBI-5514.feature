Feature: Sprint 6 Task

  As a developer, I want to stop giving support to iOS 9.x since our user base is mostly on iOS 11.x and the remaining on iOS 10.x. This will help us to reduce the time an effort need to do regression testing on this platform and also reduce the number of bugs reported that we will not address.
