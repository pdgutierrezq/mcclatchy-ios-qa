Feature: Sprint 3 Bug

  Expected:¬†We should send paywall events to Omniture for tracking. Even if the user continues navigating through stories with the stop panel visible, there should be an event sent to Omniture.

  ¬†

  Actual: The recorded events when the user sees the¬†stop-panel are¬†only those for the story as if the¬†stop-panel wasn't shown.
