          "summary": "Inmate deaths may top 550 this year if the current trend continues, putting 2018 up 29 percent from last year, the deadliest year on record in Florida prisons.",
          "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">All anyone really knows is inmate Timothy Thomas was very much alive on March 30 when he told an officer he didn’t want to go to breakfast — an act of defiance that would ultimately get him transferred to the confinement wing at Reception and Medical Center (RMC), a state prison in Lake Butler. What happened after that is a mystery, until April 2, when Thomas left confinement in a body bag, dead at age 43.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thomas was one of at least 145 prisoners to die in Florida prisons so far this year, a shocking number even for a state with one of the highest rates of inmate mortality in the country. Florida prisons ' mortality rate has surpassed even Texas, which is not known for coddling convicts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thomas was serving a life sentence for armed robbery and was known to have some health problems. But a medical examination performed when Thomas was transferred to confinement that Friday in March confirmed he was healthy upon entry. And a housing log shows Thomas spent the rest of his life in administrative confinement — a part of the prison where he would have limited access to other inmates, and would have been under the watchful eye of guards at almost all times.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The cause of Thomas’ death is under official investigation, which often takes months if not years to conclude. So family members ordered their own autopsy, performed parallel to the medical examiner's report, whose results remain under wraps. Although the cause of death from the private autopsy has not yet been released, fresh bruises and lacerations on Thomas’ body visible in photos suggest he had recently been beaten. </p><p><!-- %asset:210027334; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Advocates from the Florida Justice League, <span>a group dedicated to fighting for inmates’ rights and an advocate for Thomas’ family</span>, claim chemical agents may have been used on him, despite his asthma, which would have exempted him from that treatment.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Timothy Thomas was murdered,” said state Rep.  Kimberly Daniels, who paid a surprise visit to RMC to investigate in the days following Thomas’ death. “All of these inmates were saying at one time that they killed somebody on Easter,” Daniels said. </p><p><!-- %asset:210029704; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones responded in a statement: “We take these allegations very seriously, and have provided all available information to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, [which] has an active investigation into this death.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Miami Herald has reported on suspicious deaths in FDC facilities for years, including the infamous case of Darren Rainey, whose skin peeled from his body when he was locked for nearly two hours in a shower at Dade Correctional Institution, the deadliest prison in the state over the past five years. Often, however, reporting causes of suspicious deaths is difficult without footage from the cameras in the prisons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Department of Corrections has said it can't release surveillance video because it would compromise security.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In February, the Miami Herald won a lawsuit against the FDC for access to video footage from within prisons. The FDC appealed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Current projections of inmate mortality, based on data from the past five years, suggest the death rate in 2018 could spike 29 percent from the total in 2017, previously the deadliest year on record by a large margin. Over the past decade, other states with large prison populations, including California and Texas, have seen decreasing inmate mortality rates as Florida’s maintained its already high level before spiking in recent years, according to the most recent numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p><p><!-- %asset:210018604% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In response to the alarming trend, the Bureau of Internal Audit of the Florida Department of Corrections initiated an investigation. The summary, released in February, listed drug overdoses, hangings, and sickness as some of the ways inmates died between 2015 and 2017. But it was careful to avoid concrete conclusions about the cause of the spike because of uncertainty created by still-open investigations — a huge backlog the FDC has faced criticism for in the past.</p><p><!-- %asset:139218513% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">FDC spokeswoman Michelle Glady provided a litany of possible explanations for the increase: an aging inmate population with more serious healthcare needs, an epidemic of drug overdoses (especially from synthetic marijuana, which can cause seizures), an unhealthier population entering the system due to the rise in opioid addiction, under-serving healthcare providers, issues derived from short staffing, and the proliferation of gangs. Glady said the department isn’t waiting for investigations to conclude in order to act. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“The Office of Intelligence is using lots of different data and using the facts that we have early on to address this spike in fatalities,” she said, noting that preliminary data could be used to identify prisons with increased gang activity or drug use and take proactive action.</p><p><!-- %asset:187079013% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the recent report, inspectors did note a significant increase in accidental deaths attributed to overdoses of synthetic marijuana, often the type called K2, and the department created a video on the dangers of K2 played for all inmates this year. Glady said that more generally the goal is “making sure that we have good health services in all of our facilities,” something the department has said was inadequate in the past.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The institution where Thomas died, RMC, is a hospital prison where many sick inmates from around the region are housed. It always has one of the highest numbers of deaths, most of which are categorized as natural, from sickness or age. But if the first quarter of 2018 is any indicator, RMC could see a 27 percent spike in deaths by the end of the year, and inmates who have been there say the standard of care remains poor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“They give you aspirin, kick you in the ass, and tell you to go about your business,” said former inmate Vedero Byrd, who said he did four stints at RMC during his 18 years in the Florida prison system. He said he knows someone who has waited three years for a pair of glasses.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:210105504; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We have a MERSA, scabies, lice, pneumonia, TB and flu outbreak,” an inmate at Florida Women’s Reception Center wrote to the Miami Herald in late March. She alleged some cancer patients weren’t receiving their medications. The FDC denied the allegations of a MRSA outbreak. The Miami Herald is withholding her name to shield her from reprisal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In May 2017, a group of inmates filed a class-action lawsuit, still pending, against the FDC for failing to provide treatment to over 5,000 inmates with hepatitis C.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Glady acknowledged that the FDC had problems in the past with two private healthcare companies providing inadequate care for inmates. “Those contracts were terminated due to lack of performance,” she said. As of June 2017, Centurion of Florida took over as the sole provider of healthcare at Florida state prisons. And from 2016 to 2017 the FDC increased its healthcare budget. However, allegations of substandard conditions persist.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Byrd said from his experience, RMC was the worst, but not just because of the inadequate healthcare. The food is inedible, he said. But worse, he said, is the violence. K-Wing, the confinement wing of RMC where Thomas died, also has a particular reputation. “K Wing that is no place for anyone. They treat you like animals in there,” said Byrd. “K-Wing is where they mace you. They do a lot of stuff when you are in K-Wing.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A terrifying lore surrounds K-Wing. Inmates said it's guarded by brutal officers with scary nicknames, caricatures of violent personalities whose faces no one seems to be able to describe, but many talk about.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Everybody knows,” said former RMC inmate Randolph Brown. “They say, for black men like me with gold [teeth] in their mouth, the white man punch them out of your mouth. They keep a jar of them. That’s the story.”</p><p><!-- %asset:210105349; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Daniels, the state representative, said she heard the same thing and feared for her own safety when she toured the prison as a black woman with gold teeth. She said prison staff tried to intimidate her and her aide while they asked questions. “I couldn’t sleep for two days after I left that place,” Daniels said. “It’s a culture. That’s a city where the KKK lived. And they work in the prisons.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rumors aside, in 2015, two former RMC officers — David Elliot Moran, known as \"Sarge,\" and Thomas Jordan Driver — Klansmen, were arrested after they told an FBI informant of their plans to kill a former inmate with whom they had problems while he was in prison. A third corrections officer, Charles Thomas Newcomb, also was arrested, and all three either pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial. </p><p><!-- %asset:210104169; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Daniels received disturbing letters from several RMC inmates begging for help in the days after her visit. One inmate wrote a request for an emergency investigation into \"police brutality by prison guards and denial of medical care.\" Another wrote, \"Since I been at this institution I have witnessed and at times [been] subjected to the misconduct, abuse and more extreme inappropriate behavior by staff.\" That was followed by another message by a different inmate: “Cruelty is common here.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The chairman of the Florida Black Legislative Caucus, Rep. Bruce Antone, put out an internal memo on April 23, outlying an action plan to \"address the concerns, hearsay and allegations of physical abuse of prisoners and youth juveniles housed at Florida's Public and/or Private Prisons or Youth Juvenile Detention Facilities.” Keith Harris of the Florida Justice League <b></b>said the Black Caucus’ involvement means the FDC’s “day has come.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Inmates are being killed in their control, and they aren’t addressing it,” said Harris. But the more banal is also true: Be it from sickness, suicide, or overdose, more inmates than ever are dying in Florida prisons.</p><p><!-- %asset:177441596% --></p></div>",

          "summary": "Inmate deaths may top 550 this year if the current trend continues, putting 2018 up 29 percent from last year, the deadliest year on record in Florida prisons.",
          "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"ltr\">All anyone really knows is inmate Timothy Thomas was very much alive on March 30 when he told an officer he didn’t want to go to breakfast — an act of defiance that would ultimately get him transferred to the confinement wing at Reception and Medical Center (RMC), a state prison in Lake Butler. What happened after that is a mystery, until April 2, when Thomas left confinement in a body bag, dead at age 43.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thomas was one of at least 145 prisoners to die in Florida prisons so far this year, a shocking number even for a state with one of the highest rates of inmate mortality in the country. Florida prisons ' mortality rate has surpassed even Texas, which is not known for coddling convicts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thomas was serving a life sentence for armed robbery and was known to have some health problems. But a medical examination performed when Thomas was transferred to confinement that Friday in March confirmed he was healthy upon entry. And a housing log shows Thomas spent the rest of his life in administrative confinement — a part of the prison where he would have limited access to other inmates, and would have been under the watchful eye of guards at almost all times.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The cause of Thomas’ death is under official investigation, which often takes months if not years to conclude. So family members ordered their own autopsy, performed parallel to the medical examiner's report, whose results remain under wraps. Although the cause of death from the private autopsy has not yet been released, fresh bruises and lacerations on Thomas’ body visible in photos suggest he had recently been beaten. </p><p><!-- %asset:210027334; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Advocates from the Florida Justice League, <span>a group dedicated to fighting for inmates’ rights and an advocate for Thomas’ family</span>, claim chemical agents may have been used on him, despite his asthma, which would have exempted him from that treatment.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Timothy Thomas was murdered,” said state Rep.  Kimberly Daniels, who paid a surprise visit to RMC to investigate in the days following Thomas’ death. “All of these inmates were saying at one time that they killed somebody on Easter,” Daniels said. </p><p><!-- %asset:210029704; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones responded in a statement: “We take these allegations very seriously, and have provided all available information to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, [which] has an active investigation into this death.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Miami Herald has reported on suspicious deaths in FDC facilities for years, including the infamous case of Darren Rainey, whose skin peeled from his body when he was locked for nearly two hours in a shower at Dade Correctional Institution, the deadliest prison in the state over the past five years. Often, however, reporting causes of suspicious deaths is difficult without footage from the cameras in the prisons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Department of Corrections has said it can't release surveillance video because it would compromise security.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In February, the Miami Herald won a lawsuit against the FDC for access to video footage from within prisons. The FDC appealed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Current projections of inmate mortality, based on data from the past five years, suggest the death rate in 2018 could spike 29 percent from the total in 2017, previously the deadliest year on record by a large margin. Over the past decade, other states with large prison populations, including California and Texas, have seen decreasing inmate mortality rates as Florida’s maintained its already high level before spiking in recent years, according to the most recent numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p><p><!-- %asset:210018604% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In response to the alarming trend, the Bureau of Internal Audit of the Florida Department of Corrections initiated an investigation. The summary, released in February, listed drug overdoses, hangings, and sickness as some of the ways inmates died between 2015 and 2017. But it was careful to avoid concrete conclusions about the cause of the spike because of uncertainty created by still-open investigations — a huge backlog the FDC has faced criticism for in the past.</p><p><!-- %asset:139218513% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">FDC spokeswoman Michelle Glady provided a litany of possible explanations for the increase: an aging inmate population with more serious healthcare needs, an epidemic of drug overdoses (especially from synthetic marijuana, which can cause seizures), an unhealthier population entering the system due to the rise in opioid addiction, under-serving healthcare providers, issues derived from short staffing, and the proliferation of gangs. Glady said the department isn’t waiting for investigations to conclude in order to act. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">“The Office of Intelligence is using lots of different data and using the facts that we have early on to address this spike in fatalities,” she said, noting that preliminary data could be used to identify prisons with increased gang activity or drug use and take proactive action.</p><p><!-- %asset:187079013% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the recent report, inspectors did note a significant increase in accidental deaths attributed to overdoses of synthetic marijuana, often the type called K2, and the department created a video on the dangers of K2 played for all inmates this year. Glady said that more generally the goal is “making sure that we have good health services in all of our facilities,” something the department has said was inadequate in the past.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The institution where Thomas died, RMC, is a hospital prison where many sick inmates from around the region are housed. It always has one of the highest numbers of deaths, most of which are categorized as natural, from sickness or age. But if the first quarter of 2018 is any indicator, RMC could see a 27 percent spike in deaths by the end of the year, and inmates who have been there say the standard of care remains poor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“They give you aspirin, kick you in the ass, and tell you to go about your business,” said former inmate Vedero Byrd, who said he did four stints at RMC during his 18 years in the Florida prison system. He said he knows someone who has waited three years for a pair of glasses.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><!-- %asset:210105504; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We have a MERSA, scabies, lice, pneumonia, TB and flu outbreak,” an inmate at Florida Women’s Reception Center wrote to the Miami Herald in late March. She alleged some cancer patients weren’t receiving their medications. The FDC denied the allegations of a MRSA outbreak. The Miami Herald is withholding her name to shield her from reprisal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In May 2017, a group of inmates filed a class-action lawsuit, still pending, against the FDC for failing to provide treatment to over 5,000 inmates with hepatitis C.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Glady acknowledged that the FDC had problems in the past with two private healthcare companies providing inadequate care for inmates. “Those contracts were terminated due to lack of performance,” she said. As of June 2017, Centurion of Florida took over as the sole provider of healthcare at Florida state prisons. And from 2016 to 2017 the FDC increased its healthcare budget. However, allegations of substandard conditions persist.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Byrd said from his experience, RMC was the worst, but not just because of the inadequate healthcare. The food is inedible, he said. But worse, he said, is the violence. K-Wing, the confinement wing of RMC where Thomas died, also has a particular reputation. “K Wing that is no place for anyone. They treat you like animals in there,” said Byrd. “K-Wing is where they mace you. They do a lot of stuff when you are in K-Wing.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A terrifying lore surrounds K-Wing. Inmates said it's guarded by brutal officers with scary nicknames, caricatures of violent personalities whose faces no one seems to be able to describe, but many talk about.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Everybody knows,” said former RMC inmate Randolph Brown. “They say, for black men like me with gold [teeth] in their mouth, the white man punch them out of your mouth. They keep a jar of them. That’s the story.”</p><p><!-- %asset:210105349; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Daniels, the state representative, said she heard the same thing and feared for her own safety when she toured the prison as a black woman with gold teeth. She said prison staff tried to intimidate her and her aide while they asked questions. “I couldn’t sleep for two days after I left that place,” Daniels said. “It’s a culture. That’s a city where the KKK lived. And they work in the prisons.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rumors aside, in 2015, two former RMC officers — David Elliot Moran, known as \"Sarge,\" and Thomas Jordan Driver — Klansmen, were arrested after they told an FBI informant of their plans to kill a former inmate with whom they had problems while he was in prison. A third corrections officer, Charles Thomas Newcomb, also was arrested, and all three either pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial. </p><p><!-- %asset:210104169; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Daniels received disturbing letters from several RMC inmates begging for help in the days after her visit. One inmate wrote a request for an emergency investigation into \"police brutality by prison guards and denial of medical care.\" Another wrote, \"Since I been at this institution I have witnessed and at times [been] subjected to the misconduct, abuse and more extreme inappropriate behavior by staff.\" That was followed by another message by a different inmate: “Cruelty is common here.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The chairman of the Florida Black Legislative Caucus, Rep. Bruce Antone, put out an internal memo on April 23, outlying an action plan to \"address the concerns, hearsay and allegations of physical abuse of prisoners and youth juveniles housed at Florida's Public and/or Private Prisons or Youth Juvenile Detention Facilities.” Keith Harris of the Florida Justice League <b></b>said the Black Caucus’ involvement means the FDC’s “day has come.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Inmates are being killed in their control, and they aren’t addressing it,” said Harris. But the more banal is also true: Be it from sickness, suicide, or overdose, more inmates than ever are dying in Florida prisons.</p><p><!-- %asset:177441596% --></p></div>",

Kevin de León's insurgent U.S. Senate bid: A little-known Republican pushing back against his \"sanctuary state\" law. <br/><br/></p><p>James P. Bradley, running on an \"America First\" platform, is trailing the former California Senate leader by 1 point — a statistical tie — in the battle for second place in the June 5 primary and a spot in the November runoff, according to a poll from the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. </p><p>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein continues to hold a commanding lead.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The question now boils down to who will be her challenger in the fall?\" said Mark DiCamillo, the poll director. \"This poll shows it’s an open question.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo took a different approach with his survey of 1,738 likely voters than most pollsters this year. Many others assume the two leading Democrats in the race will advance beyond the June primary and have asked voters to pick between de León and Feinstein. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Berkeley IGS poll has gone from phone interviews to online this go-round, so DiCamillo offered a complete list of all 32 candidates running for U.S. Senate. </p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22, showed Feinstein with 28 percent of the vote and leading her top Democratic challenger across all demographics. De León was favored by 11 percent and Bradley received 10 percent. Roughly 37 percent of likely voters remain undecided. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo said he expected Republican voters to gravitate toward GOP candidates, and Bradley's support came mostly from within the party. But Bradley, who boasts a mere 75 \"likes\" on Facebook and a meager 1,200 Twitter followers, was among 11 Republicans on the list. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This was just very startling to me because one person rose out of the pack without any (Republican) challenger nearby,\" DiCamillo said. \"It seems like a head scratcher, isn’t it?\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bradley touts Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" tagline in his Twitter profile and posts in support of the cities and counties fighting de León's sanctuary state law. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, called the poll methodology unusual and said the results perplexed him, too. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"There are a couple possibilities,\" Pitney said. \"Maybe he has a base of support below the radar. Maybe it could be that Bradley is a relatively common name and someone could be associating him with some other Bradley.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pitney said the poll could signal good news for Feinstein and an easy run to November if a Republican edges out de León. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feinstein's fundraising lead over de León — $10.4 million versus $672,000 in the bank as of March 31 — gives her a major advantage. Bradley is even worse off. The Laguna Niguel Republican did not raise the minimum $5,000 to trigger a report to the Federal Election Commission.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><!-- %asset:209836124% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:201961429% --></p></div>",

                "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The two major Republican candidates in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown are battling for second place to make the November runoff, while Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has strengthened his lead, according to a new poll from UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies. <br/><br/></p><p>The poll shows businessman John Cox preferred by 18 percent of likely voters in the June 5 primary, while Assemblyman Travis Allen, R-Huntington Beach, won support from 16 percent. Both are well ahead of Democrat and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who dropped to 9 percent, down from 17 percent in December, and well behind Newsom, preferred by 30 percent.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article190925694.html\" target=\"_self\">Support for both Cox and Allen essentially doubled since December.</a></p><p>\"Both major Republican candidates are now holding an advantage over Villaraigosa for finishing second in the top-two primary,\" said poll director Mark DiCamillo.</p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22 , also \"is good news\" for Newsom, DiCamillo said. The former San Francisco mayor had 30 percent of likely voters behind him, up from 26 percent in December. \"I think he can be expected to be one of the candidates, if not the top candidate, to move on to the November general election,\" DiCamillo said.</p><p><!-- %asset:209833614% --></p><p>The latest results come about five weeks ahead of the primary, when California voters will send the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, to the November runoff.</p><p>State Treasurer John Chiang had 7 percent support from likely voters. Former schools chief Delaine Eastin had 4 percent, and 13 percent of voters are undecided. </p><p>Republicans are more likely than Democrats to turn out and vote this June — giving Cox and Allen an advantage over the other Democratic challengers, DiCamillo said. That could be even more good news for Newsom in the general election, when, historically, Democrats and independents turn out in greater numbers.</p><p>The poll also suggested voters haven't yet formed an opinion about Allen, a little-known lawmaker in the minority party, or Cox, who has never held elected office. Cox has run unsuccessfully for multiple offices, including twice for Congress in Illinois, for the 2008 Republican nomination for president and for Cook County Recorder of Deeds.</p><p>Less than a quarter have a favorable view of Cox, while 9 percent have an unfavorable view and 68 percent have no opinion, suggesting they don't know him. Allen has similar results – 20 percent favorability compared to 8 percent unfavorability. Another 72 percent of likely voters have no opinion.</p><p>Bill Whalen, a Republican and research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said the conservative uprising against California's so-called \"sanctuary state\" law and undocumented immigrants could be fueling support for Republicans, but he said to remain competitive, they'll have to appeal to independents and \"disaffected Democrats.\"</p><p>\"There aren't enough Republicans in California to do the trick,\" Whalen said, speaking of winning the governor's race. </p><p>Whalen said growing support for Newsom could be a reflection of California voters' disdain for President Donald Trump.</p><p>\"He is the most vociferous of the anti-Trump people on the ballot,\" Whalen said. \"You can argue that is paying off. The harder you bash Donald Trump, the higher your numbers go up.\"</p><p>Whalen cautioned against dismissing Villaraigosa too soon. An independent campaign run by the California Charter Schools Association Advocates is<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article208718649.html\" target=\"_self\"> funneling millions of dollars into advertisements on Villaraigosa's behalf</a>, and it's still relatively early, he said.<br/><br/></p><p>\"I don't think it's over,\" Whalen said. \"How much are voters really paying attention to the race right now? He still has five or six weeks.\"</p><p><!-- %asset:157635329% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:189757944% --></p><p><!-- %asset:177225936% --><br/><br/></p></div>",

Democrats favor it, but not quite as strongly as Republicans oppose it, according to data from the latest UC Berkeley IGS poll of more than 4,000 voters.</p><p>\"This is a very politically divisive issue,\" said Mark DiCamillo, poll director. \"For that reason, it’s likely to rear its head in the upcoming elections, both congressional and statewide.\"</p><p>The poll, conducted online from April 16 to 22, found that 56 percent of Californians favor and 41 percent oppose the measure. The immigration policy draws passionate opinions: 38 percent of voters strongly support and 32 percent strongly oppose the law.</p><p>Voters in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, both Democratic strongholds, and San Diego County support the sanctuary state law.

Kevin de León's insurgent U.S. Senate bid: A little-known Republican pushing back against his \"sanctuary state\" law. <br/><br/></p><p>James P. Bradley, running on an \"America First\" platform, is trailing the former California Senate leader by 1 point — a statistical tie — in the battle for second place in the June 5 primary and a spot in the November runoff, according to a poll from the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. </p><p>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein continues to hold a commanding lead.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The question now boils down to who will be her challenger in the fall?\" said Mark DiCamillo, the poll director. \"This poll shows it’s an open question.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo took a different approach with his survey of 1,738 likely voters than most pollsters this year. Many others assume the two leading Democrats in the race will advance beyond the June primary and have asked voters to pick between de León and Feinstein. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Berkeley IGS poll has gone from phone interviews to online this go-round, so DiCamillo offered a complete list of all 32 candidates running for U.S. Senate. </p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22, showed Feinstein with 28 percent of the vote and leading her top Democratic challenger across all demographics. De León was favored by 11 percent and Bradley received 10 percent. Roughly 37 percent of likely voters remain undecided. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo said he expected Republican voters to gravitate toward GOP candidates, and Bradley's support came mostly from within the party. But Bradley, who boasts a mere 75 \"likes\" on Facebook and a meager 1,200 Twitter followers, was among 11 Republicans on the list. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This was just very startling to me because one person rose out of the pack without any (Republican) challenger nearby,\" DiCamillo said. \"It seems like a head scratcher, isn’t it?\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bradley touts Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" tagline in his Twitter profile and posts in support of the cities and counties fighting de León's sanctuary state law. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, called the poll methodology unusual and said the results perplexed him, too. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"There are a couple possibilities,\" Pitney said. \"Maybe he has a base of support below the radar. Maybe it could be that Bradley is a relatively common name and someone could be associating him with some other Bradley.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pitney said the poll could signal good news for Feinstein and an easy run to November if a Republican edges out de León. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feinstein's fundraising lead over de León — $10.4 million versus $672,000 in the bank as of March 31 — gives her a major advantage. Bradley is even worse off. The Laguna Niguel Republican did not raise the minimum $5,000 to trigger a report to the Federal Election Commission.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><!-- %asset:209836124% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:201961429% --></p></div>",

                "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The two major Republican candidates in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown are battling for second place to make the November runoff, while Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has strengthened his lead, according to a new poll from UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies. <br/><br/></p><p>The poll shows businessman John Cox preferred by 18 percent of likely voters in the June 5 primary, while Assemblyman Travis Allen, R-Huntington Beach, won support from 16 percent. Both are well ahead of Democrat and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who dropped to 9 percent, down from 17 percent in December, and well behind Newsom, preferred by 30 percent.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article190925694.html\" target=\"_self\">Support for both Cox and Allen essentially doubled since December.</a></p><p>\"Both major Republican candidates are now holding an advantage over Villaraigosa for finishing second in the top-two primary,\" said poll director Mark DiCamillo.</p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22 , also \"is good news\" for Newsom, DiCamillo said. The former San Francisco mayor had 30 percent of likely voters behind him, up from 26 percent in December. \"I think he can be expected to be one of the candidates, if not the top candidate, to move on to the November general election,\" DiCamillo said.</p><p><!-- %asset:209833614% --></p><p>The latest results come about five weeks ahead of the primary, when California voters will send the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, to the November runoff.</p><p>State Treasurer John Chiang had 7 percent support from likely voters. Former schools chief Delaine Eastin had 4 percent, and 13 percent of voters are undecided. </p><p>Republicans are more likely than Democrats to turn out and vote this June — giving Cox and Allen an advantage over the other Democratic challengers, DiCamillo said. That could be even more good news for Newsom in the general election, when, historically, Democrats and independents turn out in greater numbers.</p><p>The poll also suggested voters haven't yet formed an opinion about Allen, a little-known lawmaker in the minority party, or Cox, who has never held elected office. Cox has run unsuccessfully for multiple offices, including twice for Congress in Illinois, for the 2008 Republican nomination for president and for Cook County Recorder of Deeds.</p><p>Less than a quarter have a favorable view of Cox, while 9 percent have an unfavorable view and 68 percent have no opinion, suggesting they don't know him. Allen has similar results – 20 percent favorability compared to 8 percent unfavorability. Another 72 percent of likely voters have no opinion.</p><p>Bill Whalen, a Republican and research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said the conservative uprising against California's so-called \"sanctuary state\" law and undocumented immigrants could be fueling support for Republicans, but he said to remain competitive, they'll have to appeal to independents and \"disaffected Democrats.\"</p><p>\"There aren't enough Republicans in California to do the trick,\" Whalen said, speaking of winning the governor's race. </p><p>Whalen said growing support for Newsom could be a reflection of California voters' disdain for President Donald Trump.</p><p>\"He is the most vociferous of the anti-Trump people on the ballot,\" Whalen said. \"You can argue that is paying off. The harder you bash Donald Trump, the higher your numbers go up.\"</p><p>Whalen cautioned against dismissing Villaraigosa too soon. An independent campaign run by the California Charter Schools Association Advocates is<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article208718649.html\" target=\"_self\"> funneling millions of dollars into advertisements on Villaraigosa's behalf</a>, and it's still relatively early, he said.<br/><br/></p><p>\"I don't think it's over,\" Whalen said. \"How much are voters really paying attention to the race right now? He still has five or six weeks.\"</p><p><!-- %asset:157635329% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:189757944% --></p><p><!-- %asset:177225936% --><br/><br/></p></div>",

Men, white people and voters over age 40 are split. Democrats favor it, but not quite as strongly as Republicans oppose it, according to data from the latest UC Berkeley IGS poll of more than 4,000 voters.</p><p>\"This is a very politically divisive issue,\" said Mark DiCamillo, poll director. \"For that reason, it’s likely to rear its head in the upcoming elections, both congressional and statewide.\"</p><p>The poll, conducted online from April 16 to 22, found that 56 percent of Californians favor and 41 percent oppose the measure. The immigration policy draws passionate opinions: 38 percent of voters strongly support and 32 percent strongly oppose the law.</p><p>Voters in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, both Democratic strongholds, and San Diego County support the sanctuary state law. Fifty-eight percent of Northern California voters outside the Bay Area and 52 percent of Central Valley voters oppose the law. Other parts of the state are even more closely divided.</p><p>Gov.

Kevin de León's insurgent U.S. Senate bid: A little-known Republican pushing back against his \"sanctuary state\" law. <br/><br/></p><p>James P. Bradley, running on an \"America First\" platform, is trailing the former California Senate leader by 1 point — a statistical tie — in the battle for second place in the June 5 primary and a spot in the November runoff, according to a poll from the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. </p><p>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein continues to hold a commanding lead.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The question now boils down to who will be her challenger in the fall?\" said Mark DiCamillo, the poll director. \"This poll shows it’s an open question.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo took a different approach with his survey of 1,738 likely voters than most pollsters this year. Many others assume the two leading Democrats in the race will advance beyond the June primary and have asked voters to pick between de León and Feinstein. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Berkeley IGS poll has gone from phone interviews to online this go-round, so DiCamillo offered a complete list of all 32 candidates running for U.S. Senate. </p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22, showed Feinstein with 28 percent of the vote and leading her top Democratic challenger across all demographics. De León was favored by 11 percent and Bradley received 10 percent. Roughly 37 percent of likely voters remain undecided. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo said he expected Republican voters to gravitate toward GOP candidates, and Bradley's support came mostly from within the party. But Bradley, who boasts a mere 75 \"likes\" on Facebook and a meager 1,200 Twitter followers, was among 11 Republicans on the list. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This was just very startling to me because one person rose out of the pack without any (Republican) challenger nearby,\" DiCamillo said. \"It seems like a head scratcher, isn’t it?\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bradley touts Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" tagline in his Twitter profile and posts in support of the cities and counties fighting de León's sanctuary state law. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, called the poll methodology unusual and said the results perplexed him, too. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"There are a couple possibilities,\" Pitney said. \"Maybe he has a base of support below the radar. Maybe it could be that Bradley is a relatively common name and someone could be associating him with some other Bradley.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pitney said the poll could signal good news for Feinstein and an easy run to November if a Republican edges out de León. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feinstein's fundraising lead over de León — $10.4 million versus $672,000 in the bank as of March 31 — gives her a major advantage. Bradley is even worse off. The Laguna Niguel Republican did not raise the minimum $5,000 to trigger a report to the Federal Election Commission.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><!-- %asset:209836124% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:201961429% --></p></div>",

Jerry Brown are battling for second place to make the November runoff, while Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has strengthened his lead, according to a new poll from UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies. <br/><br/></p><p>The poll shows businessman John Cox preferred by 18 percent of likely voters in the June 5 primary, while Assemblyman Travis Allen, R-Huntington Beach, won support from 16 percent. Both are well ahead of Democrat and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who dropped to 9 percent, down from 17 percent in December, and well behind Newsom, preferred by 30 percent.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article190925694.html\" target=\"_self\">Support for both Cox and Allen essentially doubled since December.</a></p><p>\"Both major Republican candidates are now holding an advantage over Villaraigosa for finishing second in the top-two primary,\" said poll director Mark DiCamillo.</p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22 , also \"is good news\" for Newsom, DiCamillo said. The former San Francisco mayor had 30 percent of likely voters behind him, up from 26 percent in December. \"I think he can be expected to be one of the candidates, if not the top candidate, to move on to the November general election,\" DiCamillo said.</p><p><!-- %asset:209833614% --></p><p>The latest results come about five weeks ahead of the primary, when California voters will send the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, to the November runoff.</p><p>State Treasurer John Chiang had 7 percent support from likely voters. Former schools chief Delaine Eastin had 4 percent, and 13 percent of voters are undecided. </p><p>Republicans are more likely than Democrats to turn out and vote this June — giving Cox and Allen an advantage over the other Democratic challengers, DiCamillo said. That could be even more good news for Newsom in the general election, when, historically, Democrats and independents turn out in greater numbers.</p><p>The poll also suggested voters haven't yet formed an opinion about Allen, a little-known lawmaker in the minority party, or Cox, who has never held elected office. Cox has run unsuccessfully for multiple offices, including twice for Congress in Illinois, for the 2008 Republican nomination for president and for Cook County Recorder of Deeds.</p><p>Less than a quarter have a favorable view of Cox, while 9 percent have an unfavorable view and 68 percent have no opinion, suggesting they don't know him. Allen has similar results – 20 percent favorability compared to 8 percent unfavorability. Another 72 percent of likely voters have no opinion.</p><p>Bill Whalen, a Republican and research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said the conservative uprising against California's so-called \"sanctuary state\" law and undocumented immigrants could be fueling support for Republicans, but he said to remain competitive, they'll have to appeal to independents and \"disaffected Democrats.\"</p><p>\"There aren't enough Republicans in California to do the trick,\" Whalen said, speaking of winning the governor's race. </p><p>Whalen said growing support for Newsom could be a reflection of California voters' disdain for President Donald Trump.</p><p>\"He is the most vociferous of the anti-Trump people on the ballot,\" Whalen said. \"You can argue that is paying off. The harder you bash Donald Trump, the higher your numbers go up.\"</p><p>Whalen cautioned against dismissing Villaraigosa too soon. An independent campaign run by the California Charter Schools Association Advocates is<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article208718649.html\" target=\"_self\"> funneling millions of dollars into advertisements on Villaraigosa's behalf</a>, and it's still relatively early, he said.<br/><br/></p><p>\"I don't think it's over,\" Whalen said. \"How much are voters really paying attention to the race right now? He still has five or six weeks.\"</p><p><!-- %asset:157635329% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:189757944% --></p><p><!-- %asset:177225936% --><br/><br/></p></div>",

Democrats favor it, but not quite as strongly as Republicans oppose it, according to data from the latest UC Berkeley IGS poll of more than 4,000 voters.</p><p>\"This is a very politically divisive issue,\" said Mark DiCamillo, poll director. \"For that reason, it’s likely to rear its head in the upcoming elections, both congressional and statewide.\"</p><p>The poll, conducted online from April 16 to 22, found that 56 percent of Californians favor and 41 percent oppose the measure. The immigration policy draws passionate opinions: 38 percent of voters strongly support and 32 percent strongly oppose the law.</p><p>Voters in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, both Democratic strongholds, and San Diego County support the sanctuary state law.

Kevin de León's insurgent U.S. Senate bid: A little-known Republican pushing back against his \"sanctuary state\" law. <br/><br/></p><p>James P. Bradley, running on an \"America First\" platform, is trailing the former California Senate leader by 1 point — a statistical tie — in the battle for second place in the June 5 primary and a spot in the November runoff, according to a poll from the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. </p><p>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein continues to hold a commanding lead.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The question now boils down to who will be her challenger in the fall?\" said Mark DiCamillo, the poll director. \"This poll shows it’s an open question.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo took a different approach with his survey of 1,738 likely voters than most pollsters this year. Many others assume the two leading Democrats in the race will advance beyond the June primary and have asked voters to pick between de León and Feinstein. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Berkeley IGS poll has gone from phone interviews to online this go-round, so DiCamillo offered a complete list of all 32 candidates running for U.S. Senate. </p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22, showed Feinstein with 28 percent of the vote and leading her top Democratic challenger across all demographics. De León was favored by 11 percent and Bradley received 10 percent. Roughly 37 percent of likely voters remain undecided. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">DiCamillo said he expected Republican voters to gravitate toward GOP candidates, and Bradley's support came mostly from within the party. But Bradley, who boasts a mere 75 \"likes\" on Facebook and a meager 1,200 Twitter followers, was among 11 Republicans on the list. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This was just very startling to me because one person rose out of the pack without any (Republican) challenger nearby,\" DiCamillo said. \"It seems like a head scratcher, isn’t it?\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bradley touts Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" tagline in his Twitter profile and posts in support of the cities and counties fighting de León's sanctuary state law. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, called the poll methodology unusual and said the results perplexed him, too. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"There are a couple possibilities,\" Pitney said. \"Maybe he has a base of support below the radar. Maybe it could be that Bradley is a relatively common name and someone could be associating him with some other Bradley.\" </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pitney said the poll could signal good news for Feinstein and an easy run to November if a Republican edges out de León. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feinstein's fundraising lead over de León — $10.4 million versus $672,000 in the bank as of March 31 — gives her a major advantage. Bradley is even worse off. The Laguna Niguel Republican did not raise the minimum $5,000 to trigger a report to the Federal Election Commission.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><!-- %asset:209836124% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:201961429% --></p></div>",

                "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The two major Republican candidates in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown are battling for second place to make the November runoff, while Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has strengthened his lead, according to a new poll from UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies. <br/><br/></p><p>The poll shows businessman John Cox preferred by 18 percent of likely voters in the June 5 primary, while Assemblyman Travis Allen, R-Huntington Beach, won support from 16 percent. Both are well ahead of Democrat and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who dropped to 9 percent, down from 17 percent in December, and well behind Newsom, preferred by 30 percent.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article190925694.html\" target=\"_self\">Support for both Cox and Allen essentially doubled since December.</a></p><p>\"Both major Republican candidates are now holding an advantage over Villaraigosa for finishing second in the top-two primary,\" said poll director Mark DiCamillo.</p><p>The poll, conducted April 16-22 , also \"is good news\" for Newsom, DiCamillo said. The former San Francisco mayor had 30 percent of likely voters behind him, up from 26 percent in December. \"I think he can be expected to be one of the candidates, if not the top candidate, to move on to the November general election,\" DiCamillo said.</p><p><!-- %asset:209833614% --></p><p>The latest results come about five weeks ahead of the primary, when California voters will send the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, to the November runoff.</p><p>State Treasurer John Chiang had 7 percent support from likely voters. Former schools chief Delaine Eastin had 4 percent, and 13 percent of voters are undecided. </p><p>Republicans are more likely than Democrats to turn out and vote this June — giving Cox and Allen an advantage over the other Democratic challengers, DiCamillo said. That could be even more good news for Newsom in the general election, when, historically, Democrats and independents turn out in greater numbers.</p><p>The poll also suggested voters haven't yet formed an opinion about Allen, a little-known lawmaker in the minority party, or Cox, who has never held elected office. Cox has run unsuccessfully for multiple offices, including twice for Congress in Illinois, for the 2008 Republican nomination for president and for Cook County Recorder of Deeds.</p><p>Less than a quarter have a favorable view of Cox, while 9 percent have an unfavorable view and 68 percent have no opinion, suggesting they don't know him. Allen has similar results – 20 percent favorability compared to 8 percent unfavorability. Another 72 percent of likely voters have no opinion.</p><p>Bill Whalen, a Republican and research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said the conservative uprising against California's so-called \"sanctuary state\" law and undocumented immigrants could be fueling support for Republicans, but he said to remain competitive, they'll have to appeal to independents and \"disaffected Democrats.\"</p><p>\"There aren't enough Republicans in California to do the trick,\" Whalen said, speaking of winning the governor's race. </p><p>Whalen said growing support for Newsom could be a reflection of California voters' disdain for President Donald Trump.</p><p>\"He is the most vociferous of the anti-Trump people on the ballot,\" Whalen said. \"You can argue that is paying off. The harder you bash Donald Trump, the higher your numbers go up.\"</p><p>Whalen cautioned against dismissing Villaraigosa too soon. An independent campaign run by the California Charter Schools Association Advocates is<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article208718649.html\" target=\"_self\"> funneling millions of dollars into advertisements on Villaraigosa's behalf</a>, and it's still relatively early, he said.<br/><br/></p><p>\"I don't think it's over,\" Whalen said. \"How much are voters really paying attention to the race right now? He still has five or six weeks.\"</p><p><!-- %asset:157635329% --><br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:189757944% --></p><p><!-- %asset:177225936% --><br/><br/></p></div>",
