      "summary": "The Atlanta Braves scored four runs in the seventh inning and got a Brandon Phillips RBI single in the ninth to defeat the Miami Marlins and take two of three in their weekend series at SunTrust Park on Sunday, June 18, 2017.",
      "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>As the Florida State war chant blared throughout SunTrust Park, Brandon Phillips and the Atlanta Braves did in the Marlins once more on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>A soft grounder through a crowded Miami infield from Phillips was the difference as the Braves beat the Marlins 5-4 in the bottom of the ninth.</p><p>In Saturday’s win over Miami, Phillips scored the tying run in the ninth and drove in the game-winning run in the 10th. A day later, he came up in the ninth with runners on the corners and one out.</p><p>Hoping for a double play or a play at the plate, manager Don Mattingly brought in outfielder Marcell Ozuna to play as a fifth infielder between first and second.</p><p>Phillips’ hit found its way between shortstop JT Riddle and second baseman Dee Gordon who was playing just off the bag. It appeared both were confused as to who should go for it and the ball harmlessly worked into the outfield.</p><p>“They caught some lucky breaks the last few days,” Gordon said. “But you also have to credit them. They had good at-bats in those situations to lead up to that. It's just the game. It's part of it. [Phillips] won the game for his team. That's the only way I can put it.”</p><p> <!-- %asset:156866139% --> </p><p>Riddle said he should have dove for the ball but did not thinking perhaps Gordon would. Riddle said he felt had he gone to his left, Miami could have turned the double play and forced extra innings.</p><p>“It was one of those balls kind of up the middle, should have dove for it,” Riddle said. “I should have dove for it and caught it. I think we turn the double play, even if there’s a dive involved. We turn the double play. Dee’s standing on the bag.”</p><p>A day after surrendering a four-run lead, the Miami bullpen struggled again on Sunday. Although Miami led 2-0 going into the seventh, the Marlins trailed 4-2 going into the eighth.</p><p>Starter Jose Urena gave up just one hit through six and had squashed a Braves rally (of his own design) in the second.</p><p>Urena didn’t last long in the seventh as the Braves put runners on the corners. David Phelps came on and the Braves tied the score with a sacrifice fly, then a single by Johan Camargo.</p><p>After walking Phillips to load the bases, Phelps was pulled in favor of Nick Wittgren — who gave up a two-run single down the third-base line on his first pitch to Nick Markakis.</p><p>“We lost. It could have been a lot different, but it's not,” Phelps said. “It's frustrating, obviously. We took a lead into the seventh [Sunday], we took a lead into the sixth [Saturday].</p><p>“These are games, as a bullpen, we've got to do better job.”</p><p>The Marlins got two runs back in the eighth. After Christian Yelich walked, Ozuna teed off on a 1-0 pitch from Jose Ramirez and planted it in the Miami bullpen just beyond the fence in left.</p><p>It looked like Sunday would be a short start for Urena, as he loaded the bases in the second by hitting consecutive batters after giving up a single to start things off.</p><div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-horizontal\"><p><!-- %asset:156861979; alt=\"urena1\"% --></p></div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span><p>After setting the Braves down in the first, Urena got under Atlanta’s skin by striking Matt Adams and Suzuki in the side.  Swanson sent a sharp grounder to Urena, who went home for the force and the first out.</p><p> </p><p> <!-- %asset:156876096% --> </p><p>Urena then struck out the next two batters — including starting pitcher Mike Foltynewicz — to end the threat.</p><p>“After getting out of that inning he was good all day,” Mattingly said.</p><p>Miami’s second hitter in the third. While squared to bunt with J.T. Riddle at first, Urena took his first pitch way inside.</p><p>“We were fine,” Urena said. “The two-seam, there was a lot of movement.</p><p>They were mad. We're playing, man. We're playing baseball, enough with that.”</p><p>Miami broke the scoreless game in the sixth by scoring twice.</p><div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-horizontal\"><p><!-- %asset:156861984; alt=\"bour1\"% --></p></div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span><p>With one out, the Marlins had the bases loaded for Justin Bour, and the first baseman delivered with a two-run single that scored Dee Gordon and Yelich.</p><p>Urena made a terrific defensive play to help himself out in the sixth.</p><p>After walking Phillips, Urena made a between-the-feet snare of a drive up the middle by Markakis. Urena calmly fired to Riddle covering second to start a double play.</p><p> <!-- %asset:156876069% --> </p><h3>COMING UP<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></h3><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span><strong>Monday:</strong> Washington Nationals RHP Tanner Roark (6-4, 4.39 ERA) at Marlins LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 4.15), 7:10 p.m., Marlins Park.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Washington Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez (6-1, 2.89) at Marlins RHP Edinson Volquez (3-7, 3.72), 7:10 p.m., Marlins Park.</p><div class=\"ng_mm_link1\"><div><style>.mcclatchy-embed{position:relative;padding:40px 0 56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%}.mcclatchy-embed iframe{position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%}</style><div class=\"mcclatchy-embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article156804879.html/video-embed\" width=\"100\"> </iframe></div></div></div></div>",

The man turns and looks directly into the room. He stretches his arms wide above his head, then lowers them and covers his mouth with both hands. </p><p>To investigators and the killer’s lawyers, his meaning seems clear:</p><p>Keep your mouth shut.</p><p>The man making that gesture isn’t another inmate. He’s a manager at Lanesboro Correctional Institution.</p><p>A lawyer for the killer said in a court hearing that he believes prison officials either sanctioned the September 2012 attack or looked the other way. Two state investigators said they reached the same opinion.</p><p>No prison officials have been criminally charged. But Jeffery Wall – the unit manager who made the gesture – has been accused in federal lawsuits of facilitating two other gang attacks the same year. One prisoner alleges that Wall ran a “violent, contraband-driven fiefdom.”</p><p>An investigation by The Charlotte Observer found that state prison policies and management failures allow corruption to thrive. Officers and staff have orchestrated illegal smuggling operations, beaten shackled inmates and engaged in sex with prisoners.</p><p>Experts say such corruption jeopardizes prison workers, wastes taxpayer dollars and endangers the public.</p><p>Wall, now 45, wouldn’t talk to the Observer. In a court filing, he said he never facilitated attacks. </p><p>State prison leaders refused requests for all surveillance videos that show incidents in which Wall is accused of helping inmates wage attacks. They assert that releasing the videos could jeopardize prison security.</p><p>But, with the help of a source, the Observer obtained a prison surveillance video from the 2012 attack that killed inmate Wesley Turner, providing a rare glimpse into a prison murder.</p><div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-horizontal\"><p><!-- %asset:152332322; alt=\"RAL_ PRISON5NE032417CEL\"% --></p></div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><h3>The meeting<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Drive down U.S. 74 toward the beach and you may not realize it’s there. About 45 miles from Charlotte, just beyond a grove of trees, Lanesboro Correctional Institution houses some of the state’s most violent criminals.</p><p>This sprawling complex of concrete and barbed wire in Anson County holds 1,800 inmates, including more than 350 men convicted of murder and 150 convicted of rape.</p><p>It’s so dangerous that some officers begin their work days by asking those coming off the previous shift how many assaults they’ve just seen.</p><p></p><p>On the morning of Sept. 28, 2012, the day that Turner was stabbed to death, there were rumors of potential violence. One inmate warned Lanesboro prison officials that Latino gang members were armed with homemade knives and planning an attack. </p><p>Surveillance video from that day offers a look behind the prison’s walls:</p><p>Inmates mill about in a hallway, some high-fiving, others hugging or bumping fists, as if they are high-school students changing classes. </p><p>That’s Wall in the white shirt and tie entering the hallway on the video. A prison system veteran who earned about $41,000 a year, Wall was one of Lanesboro’s four unit managers, overseeing a block with nearly 300 inmates. Officers and prisoners say he had a reputation for doing favors for gang members.</p><p><!-- %asset:153331144% --></p><p>At 11:49 a.m., less than half an hour before the fatal fight begins, Wall walks into an office with an inmate. Seconds later, another prisoner follows. Both inmates are members of MS-13, a powerful Latino gang. </p><p>The first to enter is Julio Zelaya-Sorto, convicted of shooting and killing a man at a Greensboro nightclub. </p><p>Next is Joel “Sour” Ortiz, who is in prison for armed robbery and shooting a motorist in the head during a road-rage attack on Raleigh’s beltline. </p><p>Combined, they’ve been cited for dozens of offenses while in prison, including weapon possession, fighting and assault.</p><p>The two inmates meet in the office with Wall, other administrators and members of the United Blood Nation gang, off and on, for 17 minutes. Prison surveillance video doesn’t capture that meeting, so it’s unclear what they discussed. </p><p>It’s also unclear where Zelaya-Sorto and Ortiz go immediately after the meeting breaks up. But minutes later, they are walking through a prison hallway with weapons, headed for a fight. </p><h3>Awaiting trouble<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Inside his cell block, inmate Christopher Cook expects trouble. </p><p>Cook is a leader of the Folk Nation, a rival gang, and he has heard rumors of escalating gang tensions.</p><p>In Lanesboro, as in many other prisons, gangs often battle for control over drugs and cellphones – a lucrative trade for both inmates and corrupt officers.</p><p>Cook is unarmed. He pleads with two other inmates to lend him a weapon. They refuse. </p><p><!-- %asset:153331209% --></p><p>On the video, Cook, 41, is the tall inmate gesturing to other prisoners. He got the nickname “Ghost Face” as the only white kid hanging out in a Durham housing project. He joined the Folk Nation at age 16, was convicted of damaging property soon afterward, and later committed armed robbery, kidnapping and more than a dozen other crimes.</p><p>From a common area, Cook can see Zelaya-Sorto and Ortiz – the prisoners who have just met with Wall. </p><p>They are joined by a third Latino gang member, Gregorio Vazquez, who is in prison for second-degree murder.</p><p>The three wait outside Cook’s cell block for more than a minute. They’re within feet of an officer who controls the locked door to the block. He’s a rookie at Lanesboro who is new to that job, still learning who to let in and who to keep out.</p><p>The officer opens the door for an inmate, and the three gang members follow him into a cell block where they don’t belong.</p><p><!-- %asset:153331334% --></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><h3>A bloody battle<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Another prisoner also slips through the door.</p><p>Wesley Turner has come to defend Cook, his friend. Both are members of the Folk Nation.</p><p>Turner, 35, a convicted murderer nicknamed “Thug Life,” has served most of his 21-year prison sentence. Cook said he met him in 2001, when Turner came to his aid in a fight against correctional officers. But, Cook said, Turner usually kept to himself.</p><p>This morning, Turner had warned Cook that Latino gang members planned to create trouble between the Bloods and the Folks. </p><p>Turner walks over to Cook and they stand shoulder to shoulder, braced for an attack.</p><p></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><h3>First to arrive<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Zelaya-Sorto pulls out a shank – a handmade knife – from inside his jumpsuit and lunges at Cook. Seconds later, Ortiz grabs a shank from his waistband and also begins slashing Cook. </p><p>Just out of view, in the lower right-hand corner of the video, a second fight erupts.</p><p>Vazquez repeatedly stabs Turner with a shank. </p><p><!-- %asset:153331434% --></p><p>The control booth officer sees the fight, picks up a radio and makes a call.</p><p>The fight lasts about 40 seconds.</p><p>Wall is the first staff member to arrive. He goes straight to Cook, who is bleeding, and motions for him to get down on his knees.</p><p>Officers sprint in behind Wall, cornering the three attackers. They pepper-spray and beat Vazquez with batons to stop him from stabbing Turner.</p><p>But it’s too late.</p><p>Turner lies bleeding to death on the concrete floor.</p><h3>Message to the killer?<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Shortly after 3 p.m., almost three hours after the attack, correctional officers lead Vazquez into a nurse’s office. </p><p>Wall and another prison manager walk down the hallway minutes later, then stop outside the office. </p><p>Now comes the gesture. Wall turns and looks directly into the room where Vazquez waits. He stretches his arms high. Then he covers his mouth. He stares into the office for a few moments before walking away.</p><p><!-- %asset:153331444% --></p><p> Attorneys for Vazquez said their client never told them what led to the fight. But Daniel Roberts, one of the attorneys, told a judge at a court hearing his theory was that “Mr. Wall and the Blood Nation gang likely ordered this to happen. If not ordered it, at least knew it was going to happen.” </p><p>Roberts also told the judge he believed Wall’s gesture was a signal “not to give any statements, for them not to talk about what had happened.”</p><p>Jeremy Smith, who also represented Vazquez, formed the same opinion: “Our theory is that, at best, the corrections officers knew (the attack) was going to happen and did nothing to stop it,” he told the Observer.</p><p>“It's odd that (the gang members) are meeting with Wall minutes before the attack,” Smith said. “And with Wall's signal after the fact, telling (Vazquez) essentially to be quiet, I don't know what other inference you can draw from it.”</p><div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-horizontal\"><p><!-- %asset:152332292; alt=\"PRISON_PROBLEMS_07.JPG.JPG\"% --></p></div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><h3>The missing shanks<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Less than an hour after the fight, SBI agent Audria Bridges began investigating the murder.</p><p>Bridges, 46, a North Carolina State graduate and former Concord police officer, was familiar with Lanesboro. She and her colleagues in the Charlotte SBI office were frequently called to investigate crimes there, including officers charged with bringing drugs to inmates. </p><p>For months, Bridges tried to make sense of what she saw at the murder scene and on surveillance video. </p><p>Where, she wondered, were the shanks used to attack Cook and Turner? </p><p>All three of the Latino inmates had sharp weapons. Inmates involved in the fight told investigators that one of the shanks was a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3718800-Search-Warrant-Affidavit-in-Wesley-Turner-Case.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">“real long knife,” </a>another resembled a razor, and the third was a plastic toilet bowl brush sharpened at one end. But only one shank was recovered.</p><p>In interviews with investigators, officer Kearry Hinson said he picked up one of the weapons used in the fight and gave it to Wall. </p><p>Phillip Boney, a former Lanesboro officer, told the Observer that right after the fight, he saw Wall put a shank inside an unlocked wooden podium near the cell block. The shank didn’t belong there. State prison policy says weapons – potential criminal evidence – should be kept in a locked container in the prison’s armory.</p><p>Bridges also questioned why Wall met with two gang members minutes before they attacked Cook.</p><p>Wall told Bridges that he was asking about rumors of a planned attack on him. Another prison manager in that cramped office at the time told investigators that she was not paying attention as Wall spoke to the gang members, Bridges said. </p><p>“I believe it’s not a coincidence that they are in that office within minutes of carrying out that hit,” Bridges told an Observer reporter.</p><p>In July 2013, 10 months after the attack, Bridges was at Lanesboro interviewing an inmate when she got a tip.</p><h3>Hidden weapons <span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Wall had been assigned to another prison while the Turner investigation was underway. A female officer told Bridges that Wall just called looking for help. The officer said Wall asked her to go into his old office and retrieve a bag of shanks from the ceiling.</p><p>Bridges and a prison captain searched the ceiling and found videos of prison fights, nine rods, a long metal shank and three bloody shanks.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Wall arrived at the Lanesboro parking lot, according to a prison document. An officer at the gate house said Wall was upset and had a gun visible in his car, which violates prison policy.</p><p>“They have nothing to worry about,” Wall told the officer, according to the document, “because if I wanted to get anyone, I could get them touched from the outside.”</p><p>Prison officials considered that a clear threat to staff. Three weeks later, Wall was fired. His <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3718798-Jeffery-Wall-s-Dismissal-Letter.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">dismissal letter </a>states that he helped create conditions “that increased the chance of death or serious bodily injury” to employees, inmates or the public. </p><p>Asked to explain the shanks in his ceiling, Wall told his bosses he was planning to put them in a display case to train new staff members. </p><p>That explanation didn’t make sense to Bridges. “In my opinion, it didn’t seem logical to hide them in the ceiling,” she said. </p><p>Bridges said forensic tests did not conclusively tie any of the weapons in Wall’s office to the attack on Turner. Prison officials refused to open Cook’s cell door so that investigators could get a DNA sample, Bridges said. If Cook’s DNA had turned up on any of the shanks in Wall’s office, that could have helped tie them to the attack.</p><p>Bridges said that, in her opinion, Wall’s meeting with the Latino gang members was connected in some way with the subsequent fight. But after investigating for more than a year, the SBI closed the case. “I didn’t have enough cooperation to connect the dots,” she said.</p><p>Tony Underwood, who headed the Charlotte area’s SBI office at the time, said he’s still troubled by what investigators learned about Wall’s relationship with inmates.</p><p>“It did not appear to be a normal prison relationship that a correctional officer should have with inmates,” Underwood said.</p><p>In an email to the Observer, state prison leaders said they have “no evidence to support that conversations and gestures with inmates seen in the surveillance video are anything other than normal discussions with the inmate population.”</p><h3>Wall: I did nothing wrong <span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Two pending federal lawsuits allege that Wall and his officers sold weapons to gang members. The suits also contend that Wall facilitated attacks on two other inmates the same year Turner was killed.</p><p>The Observer repeatedly tried to reach Wall to discuss the Turner murder and the lawsuit allegations. He did not respond. His attorney, Joseph Ledford, wouldn’t discuss his case and said he advised his client not to talk.</p><p>In a court filing, Wall denied the federal lawsuit claims, saying he never facilitated attacks or gave gang members preferential treatment. </p><p>“At no time did (I) knowingly or willingly allow any inmate … to attack any inmate,” he wrote.</p><h3>Fate of attackers<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>In 2014, Vazquez pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for killing Turner. Zelaya-Sorto and Ortiz pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon. </p><p>All three are serving their sentences at other prisons. </p><p>Ortiz is scheduled to get out in 2019. Vazquez and Zelaya-Sorto are scheduled for release in 2028. The three continue to cause trouble: Since Turner’s death, they’ve been written up for about 50 infractions, including weapon possession, setting fires and assaulting staff.</p><p>Ortiz and Vazquez didn’t respond to the Observer’s requests for information about the case. </p><p>Zelaya-Sorto did reply to the Observer, but wrote only: “Este caso esta serado” – “This case is closed.”</p><div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-horizontal\"><p><!-- %asset:152332282; alt=\"PRISON_PROBLEMS_06.JPG.JPG\"% --></p></div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><h3>Lanesboro’s troubles <span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Five years after the murder, Lanesboro’s problems continue.</p><p>David Mitchell, a Harley-riding former Navy officer brought in to run the prison in 2014, was attacked three times in his first eight months – once stabbed in the neck by an inmate wielding a dagger fashioned from melted plastic. Before he left in 2016 to oversee 15 state prisons in western North Carolina, Mitchell told the Observer: “I’m certain there are people involved with gang activity that work here.”</p><p>At least eight Lanesboro officers were caught bringing in drugs, cellphones and tobacco from early 2013 to early 2017, according to law enforcement records.</p><p>Since the beginning of 2016, more than 30 stabbings occurred. </p><p>In an 11-week period in early 2016, more than 15 staff members left Lanesboro under suspicion of wrongdoing, Mitchell said. Among them: a manager suspected of being too close to inmates. Another was criminally charged with bringing heroin to a prisoner.</p><p>In February, the FBI charged former Lanesboro officer Evangeline Hunt with smuggling in drugs and other contraband for inmates. In a recorded phone conversation, Hunt told a friend she knew a “bunch” of corrupt officers, according to an FBI affidavit.</p><p>But local law enforcement officials are optimistic about changes at Lanesboro. </p><p>In January, police and prosecutors teamed up with the prison’s new administrator, John Herring, to begin criminally charging inmates caught with weapons.

He sued and won a $10,000 settlement from the state.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>April 2009 - Inmate Prentiss Quick complained of chest pains and requested medical help, but no one at the prison got him to a nurse or a doctor, a correctional officer and an inmate said. He was found dead in his cell the following morning, a victim of coronary artery disease. Officers skipped their required rounds at the prison the night Quick died, records show.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>December 2010 - Thirteen inmates assaulted staff members in various attacks, state records show. </p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>April 2011 - Richard Neely, a former top administrator at Lanesboro, was charged with felony obstruction of justice following allegations that he destroyed video footage that might have shown officers using excessive force in a fight with inmates. Prosecutors later dismissed the charge because of problems with the credibility of witnesses.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>August 2011 - Eighteen inmates assaulted staff members throughout the month.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>September 2012 - The stabbing death of inmate Wesley Turner spurred an SBI investigation and led to three felony convictions. Surveillance videos and shanks hidden in the ceiling of a prison manager’s office raised questions about whether prison officials helped plan the attack or allowed it to happen.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>January 2013 - A former Lanesboro correctional officer began sending letters to state officials, describing several incidents in which some prison officials appeared to collude with gang members.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>November 2013 - A gang member cut a correctional officer three times on the neck and face, requiring 39 stitches, according to a police report. Following the attack, more than 800 inmates were put on lockdown for several months. Searches found numerous cellphones, improvised weapons and marijuana.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>October 2014 - Prison administrator David Mitchell was stabbed in the neck by an inmate wielding a plastic shank. That was one of three times inmates attacked Mitchell.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>November 2014 - Five former Lanesboro inmates filed a <a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9233477.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">federal lawsuit </a>alleging that officers at the Anson County prison repeatedly helped gang-affiliated inmates get weapons and wage attacks. </p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>September 2016 - Inmates stabbed a sergeant and a lieutenant at the prison, and hit two other officers with a broom handle.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>October 2016 - Former correctional officer Scarlette Hodges pleaded guilty to smuggling drugs, tobacco and other contraband to at least one inmate. Other inmates had told investigators that Hodges was supplying contraband to an inmate gang member who she later admitted was her boyfriend, court records show. Hodges was sentenced to two years in federal prison.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>February 2017 - Former officer Evangeline Hunt was charged with smuggling in drugs and other contraband for inmates.</p></div><div class=\"ng_factbox\"><div class=\"ng_factbox_head\"><p>We want your tips</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p>Do you want to share documents or information about the North Carolina prisons?

When the boy asked where his mother was, Avalos told the boy, “She was gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the boy did see his mother’s body before his father announced it was time for him to go to school, the prosecutor stated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDefense attorney Richard Watts told jurors that Avalos believed his wife had brought the streets into their home and was having affairs with rival gang members. He conceded that Avalos had hit his wife so hard it left her unconscious and then he killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He had to fight for his life,” Watts said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Avalos was loading his son into his vehicle, Potter showed up at the home. The two women worked together cleaning houses, so Avalos knew she would find his wife’s body and he wasn’t ready for the police to be called yet — so he went inside and shot and killed her, Brodsky said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter dropping his son at daycare and dumping his SUV at the Walmart on State Road 64 in an effort to continue avoiding detection, Avalos took a taxi cab to Bayshore Baptist Church on U.S. 41, the state attorney said. When Avalos got to the church, Battle was not there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBattle’s wife was in the church office, however, and Avalos began telling her how he believed their spouses were having an affair with one another, Brodsky said. Then she watched as Avalos walked out and shot her husband dead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAvalos went into hiding in the woods behind the Pine Haven Mobile Home Park, just blocks from the church, before reemerging two days later on the wooden deck at a couple’s mobile home. Brodsky told jurors they would hear from them how he admitted to being the person who killed “those people” that they had probably heard about. They prayed with him, fed him and allowed him to call his mother, Brodsky said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAvalos asked for beer before leaving — knowing it was the last chance to have one. And after he left, the couple called 911 and then drove to the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office to report what happened, Brodsky said. A caravan of deputies and detectives arrived at the mobile home to find Avalos drinking, with his .45 automatic caliber pistol at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn testimony, Avalos’ uncle, sheriff’s office Lt. Joel Perez, recalled how Avalos had called him just after the slayings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He just wanted to let me know that he left two bodies at his house for me,” Perez testified.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis nephew said he was serious and that he didn’t want his kids to see the bodies when they got home from school, Perez said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I was drawn back,” Perez said under questioning by Assistant State Attorney Art Brown. “I didn’t ask him any more questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe would talk to his nephew again two days later, just as he was about to be arrested. He would speak to him a third time when lead homicide detectives Jeffrey Bliss and John Kenney called him while they were interviewing Avalos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerez testified he did not think Amber Avalos was having an affair with Battle, despite what Andy Avalos had told him numerous times in the months leading up to the killings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter he testified, Perez sat in the courtroom next to Avalos’ parents, his sister Nora Avalos and Andres Avalos Sr.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNora Avalos was absent from the courtroom when Perez took the stand, however.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the courtroom were \u003ca href=\"http://www.bradenton.com/news/local/article118706003.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"\u003emembers of the Battle family \u003c/a\u003eand Amber Avalos’ family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJurors saw photographs of both crime scenes during the testimony of several sheriff’s office crime scene technicians.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmber Avalos — whose body was mangled and nearly unrecognizable — was half-suspended in the home’s laundry room, surrounded by a mess of laundry. Potter was seen lying face down in the home’s hallway, purse still in hand. Battle was seen lying not far from the church office door.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeachers at the Happy Cubs Daycare, where the couple’s then 4-year-old attended preschool, testified about their encounter with Avalos when he dropped the boys off, after having already murdered the women, according to prosecutors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoanne Gartley, one of the teachers, made a comment to the boy about being late, to which Avalos said, “Is that a problem. Am I in trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis tone of voice was louder than usual, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe agreed when asked by defense attorney Andrew Crawford that Avalos seemed nervous, antsy and paranoid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAvalos had five beers before deputies and detectives with the sheriff’s office arrived at the mobile home to arrest him, Deputy Joshua Escher testified. Avalos cooperated during his arrest, for which Escher thanked him, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He said he had thought about going a different way, but thought otherwise,” Escher said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

After getting drilled by the Gattis line drive, he continued pitching and managed to get through the inning despite allowing his first hit, an Alex Bregman double.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe even came out to bunt in the fifth, and dropped down a beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut he was wearing a black compression sleeve to alleviate swelling, had engaged in a dugout chat with manager Don Mattingly, and didn’t return for the sixth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The fact they were able to get the ice on it quickly and keep the swelling down, we feel like it gives us a fighting chance to make his next start,” Mattingly said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn came Tazawa, who promptly struck out George Springer to start things. Following a Josh Reddick double, he retired Jose Altuve on a fly ball. Then it all came unraveled for Tazawa, one of the Marlins’ offseason free agent signings. He walked Carlos Correa, plunked Gattis to load the bases, and got his head rocked by Gurriel’s grand slam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt hasn’t been a good season so far for Tazawa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Obviously it’s probably not what he would want,” Mattingly said. “Probably not as good as we were expecting at this point. But that doesn’t mean the next time out he isn’t good and builds on that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Astros didn’t stop after Tazawa came out, scoring two more runs in the seventh off Brad Ziegler.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOffensively, the Marlins had chances to score but failed to deliver. They went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position, with Christian Yelich’s RBI single in the fifth providing the lone hit in those situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the past four games, all but one of their 10 total runs have been produced by home runs. Justin Bour hit one out in the eighth, his third homer in the past four games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

We are seeing a massive disruption in the network operations across the globe,” Frayman said in an interview Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_digital\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-inline-square\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:150639657; alt=\"New Yuri Frayman\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003eNone of the firms his company protects have reported any disruptions from the so-called “WannaCry” ransomware virus, he said. But as the attack has unfolded, Zenedge has been talking with industry security specialists around the globe about how they are mitigating the damage and seeking to stabilize large infrastructure companies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat really worries Frayman is what comes next in this attack, and ones to follow. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompanies such as FedEx will throw everything at this problem in the next three or four days at an unbelievable cost, said Frayman, who has himself been expecting a FedEx delivery for the past two days. But less-sophisticated firms may may not even know a virus lurks in their system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA second problem, he said, is the massive shortage of cyber-security experts. The enemies are hackers who are “years ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTelecommuting also creates risk. “Ninety-eight percent of the world population doesn’t know if their home has been hacked. If I have your home, I can hack your corporate environment. Many people around the world work from home, and that is another black hole that is ready to explode.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution – beyond turning off the internet – is commitment to vigilance, Frayman said. Generally, the largest financial services companies are very proactive, appropriating the proper budget, staff and training and putting key processes in place. But “take a step outside of that and you will see across the board that corporations have not taken this seriously.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHiring a chief security officer is not enough, he said. “It’s not about buying cyber insurance and hiring a couple of people – it’s about discipline.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- %highline_quote:1; hidden=\"1\"% --\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving a dedicated staff and/or vendors whose single task is to secure and protect the company is key. So is continual staff training. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“You can’t just be clicking anymore.... Hackers are using very sophisticated tools to mimic regular emails you get every single day,” Frayman said. If you click on one that downloads a virus, it eventually could discover the system administration credentials. “Once [the hackers] know those, they can do whatever they want.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eZenedge currently has about 250 clients spanning the financial, ecommerce, gaming, healthcare and manufacturing industries worldwide and also protects large internet service providers, said Frayman, who previously helped lead and sell four other companies.

A charter bus with nice cloth seats loads our sweaty bodies near Sawgrass Mills Mall and drops us at the finishers’ chute, where volunteers provide bagels, a certain energy drink, bananas, and boxes and boxes of oranges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe worldwide winner from the field of 86,240 was a wheelchair racer, Swede Aron Anderson.

          "content": "\u003cdiv xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eMan, it’s dangerous flying the unfriendly skies these days. What used to be a jaunt through the clouds has become a test of nerves. Planes, and airports in particular, have been transformed into shelters for the cantankerous and the grouchy, the entitled and the misguided. And all this has happened in less than a decade. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s going on? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn these past few weeks we’ve been treated to incidents that defy explanation and basic human decency. In early April, David Dao was dragged off his overbooked flight by airport security after refusing to cede his seat to United Airlines crew members, causing Dao to suffer a concussion, a broken nose and other injuries. The incident was captured on cellphone video in all its cringe-worthy glory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a result, federal lawmakers, who never miss a chance to grandstand, took U.S. airline chiefs to task, warning them that if they didn’t up their game they risked increased government oversight. Yet, the flying experience — I’ve flown twice since the Dao episode — has not improved in any measurable way. Some might reasonably argue that it has grown worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider: Delta booted a family off an overnight flight from Maui to California after the airline wanted to put another passenger in the seat the family had initially bought for their 18-year-old son but was planning to use for their 2-year-old. A video showed the crew telling the parents they would go to jail and that their children would be placed in foster care, dreadful and empty threats both.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast week, a hair-pulling fight broke out at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport after Spirit Airlines canceled nine flights. Hundreds of angry passengers mobbed the ticket counter and at least two women tried to swing at Broward sheriff’s deputies. Three were arrested for disorderly conduct, inciting a riot, trespassing after a warning, and resisting arrest with violence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly after that boondoggle, two passengers got into a full-blown fistfight on a Southwest Airlines plane. One of the men was punched several times before passengers and flight attendants intervened. Then a Missouri woman flying on a regional U.S. carrier claimed she had to use a cup to pee after flight attendants wouldn’t let her use the restroom. She dutifully wrote about it in a lengthy Facebook post.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, sometimes it’s not the airlines’ fault. The Obnoxious Traveler is very much alive and well in America — believe me, I’ve sat next to one or two — as is the Entitled Passenger, the Unreasonable Journeyer and the Drunk Tourist. How else to explain the two imbeciles fighting on the Southwest plane? And the woman with her pee cup — turns out that attendants never suggested a cup and that the woman, who claims an overactive bladder, wanted to urinate during the plane’s descent, which is against FAA regulations. (Has she not heard of Depends?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, the Spirit Airlines’ cancellations were a result of a labor dispute and eventually a federal court ordered the pilots to stop an illegal work slowdown and return to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose explanations, however, are not meant to give the airlines a free pass. They deserve plenty of blame. As Americans have grown taller (and fatter), airplane seats have been shrinking, leaving most of us feeling like canned sardines marinating in olive oil. Flights are often late, fees are exorbitant, lines to board and deplane are disorganized, and the possibility of getting a checked-in bag within 15 minutes of arrival is nonexistent. Early 20th century transatlantic travel in steerage class, the stuff of conscience-raising novels, has nothing on 21st century economy seats. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAirlines might do well to take some pointers from Disney, where trains run on time and employees smile through a litany of awkward and embarrassing situations. Disney truly works wonders with customer service. At their parks, parents willingly hand over a small fortune to stand in line in the heat with bawling babies and sugar-infused children for an experience they’ve been convinced is both worthwhile and essential. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAna Veciana-Suarez writes about family and social issues.

The first chapter is about desserts, an acknowledgement of the Southern sweet tooth. A full chapter is devoted to fried food. There’s even a chapter of cocktails and mocktails, from mango margaritas to drinks inspired by the rivalry between her two home-state teams, Auburn and Alabama.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_mm_link1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"videowrapper\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iyeIAved3I\" width=\"560\"\u003e \u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s gumbo, the Cajun-Creole stew (typically Creole gumbo has tomatoes, Cajun does not) that is one of Buffett’s early food memories and now her signature dish. This cookbook has recipes for five gumbos, including Gumbo Z’Herbe, an almost-meatless stew built on a variety of greens and flavored — if you’re not a vegetarian purist — with a ham hock that can be removed before serving. It also has Lucy’s Signature Summer Seafood Gumbo, with crab, shrimp, tomatoes and okra, which we tested for this article.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“My grandmother would have a pot of gumbo on the stove every Friday,” Buffett said in a phone interview, recalling the weekends spent at her grandmother’s house in small-town Mississippi. Being a Catholic, her grandmother made seafood gumbo on Fridays — usually with enough left over for a side dish at Sunday dinners. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYoung Lucy loved hanging out in the kitchens of both her grandmothers, always underfoot, watching them prepare the enormous spreads for Sunday dinners. The passion for cooking skipped a generation, though, and her mother didn’t pass along any culinary skills. Later, as a divorced mother of two children, Buffett taught herself to cook. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_digital\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-inline-square\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:150735422; alt=\"Silver Queen Corn Salad_credit Angie Mosier\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Gumbo is not the first thing I learned how to cook,” she said, “but it is the first thing I learned to master. So it has a lot of meaning for me.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her first restaurant, LuLu’s Sunset Grill on Weeks Bay, Alabama, she featured gumbo. “Gumbo was something special from my earliest memories of family love and togetherness, and now here it was, paying my bills, making my customers happy, feeding my children,” she wrote in “Gumbo Love.” “People kept on coming for gumbo and the company and the atmosphere.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGumbo begins with roux, a combination of hot fat and flour that adds flavor and acts as a thickener. Then comes the Holy Trinity of New Orleans cuisine — chopped onions, celery and bell pepper — followed by stock, tomatoes for Creole-style gumbo and a long simmer. Seasonings are added, including chiles if you like it spicy. Chicken or sausage meat not too much later; seafood just a few minutes before serving, and finally chopped green onions and parsley or cilantro. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It takes courage to make a gumbo,” Buffett wrote, and indeed it does. Okra is used to thicken some gumbos, but cooked wrong, it can make a slimy, stringy mess. Roux is intimidating even for experienced cooks. Cooked at a high temperature that requires constant attention, it is brought just to the edge of burning. Done right, roux adds a lovely, toasty flavor. A few seconds too long and it burns, its flavor scorched and bitter. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Roux takes practice,” says Buffett, who writes about roux as if it were a person, a temperamental diva. It steams, it spits and leaves battle scars on a cook’s arms. “It’s kind of a rite of passage for Southern cooks.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuffett moved around a lot, learning the cooking styles of each place and developing her own takes on them, which she included in “Gumbo Love.” She lived in Key West with her brother, Jimmy Buffett (yes, \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e Jimmy Buffett), where the Cuban influence led her to include picadillo and black bean soup. She also included tres leches, in which she substituted buttermilk for heavy cream, giving the cake tanginess to offset the heavy sweetness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom New Orleans, inspired by the muffaletta sandwich, she created recipes for a chopped muffaletta salad (salami, ham, Italian sausage, provolone, olives, pickled vegetables) and muffaletta sliders, made with tubes of Pillsbury French bread dough cut into roll-size pieces. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_digital\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-inline-square\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:150735397; alt=\"Day-After Brisket Po' Boy_credit Angie Mosier\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe developed recipes for many of the fish pulled from the Gulf: grouper with balsamic butter glaze, bronzed yellowtail snapper with citrus beurre blanc sauce, scampi amandine and crabmeat au gratin. True to Southern traditions, many of the recipes use lots of butter or cream, but Buffett notes: “I did put some healthy choices in there.” One of them is red snapper Veracruz, from a port city on Mexico’s Gulf Coast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe tested about 10 of her recipes, starting with her signature seafood gumbo, which was delicious. Other favorites: shrimp and crab dip, pimento cheese (next time I’ll add more hot sauce and worry less about finding a specialty beer), corn salad (another healthy choice), pasta with crawfish cream sauce (I substituted shrimp for crawfish), and a traditional buttermilk chess pie jazzed up with orange zest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_digital\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-inline-square\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:150735427; alt=\"pimento cheese\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, I liked the variety of choices in “Gumbo Love” and the way Buffett strung together her favorites from a region already well-loved for its cuisine. Some recipes were complicated and some were simple, but all were easy to follow and more accessible than those in many cookbooks by celebrity chefs or big-name restaurants. Many of those we tested felt like comfort food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’m not fancy and I’m self-taught. I don’t consider myself a gourmet chef,” Buffett said.

Thirty minutes before serving, add the green onion, parsley and lemon juice to the gumbo. Cover and cook for 15 minutes. Add the shrimp and crabmeat, mix well and cook for 2 minutes. Cover and turn off the heat. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes more to cook the seafood. The gumbo will stay hot for a long time. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Taste and adjust the seasonings; serve over cooked white rice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

In Key West, Cuban black bean soup and lobster salad made with Florida lobsters. Fried oysters and oysters on the half-shell from Apalachicola Bay. Fried chicken, chess pie, pimento cheese, po’boys and cornbread all along the Alabama-Mississippi coast. And from New Orleans, muffalettas, shrimp Remoulade and gumbo.

The first chapter is about desserts, an acknowledgement of the Southern sweet tooth. A full chapter is devoted to fried food. There’s even a chapter of cocktails and mocktails, from mango margaritas to drinks inspired by the rivalry between her two home-state teams, Auburn and Alabama.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_mm_link1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"videowrapper\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iyeIAved3I\" width=\"560\"\u003e \u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s gumbo, the Cajun-Creole stew (typically Creole gumbo has tomatoes, Cajun does not) that is one of Buffett’s early food memories and now her signature dish. This cookbook has recipes for five gumbos, including Gumbo Z’Herbe, an almost-meatless stew built on a variety of greens and flavored — if you’re not a vegetarian purist — with a ham hock that can be removed before serving. It also has Lucy’s Signature Summer Seafood Gumbo, with crab, shrimp, tomatoes and okra, which we tested for this article.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“My grandmother would have a pot of gumbo on the stove every Friday,” Buffett said in a phone interview, recalling the weekends spent at her grandmother’s house in small-town Mississippi. Being a Catholic, her grandmother made seafood gumbo on Fridays — usually with enough left over for a side dish at Sunday dinners. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYoung Lucy loved hanging out in the kitchens of both her grandmothers, always underfoot, watching them prepare the enormous spreads for Sunday dinners. The passion for cooking skipped a generation, though, and her mother didn’t pass along any culinary skills. Later, as a divorced mother of two children, Buffett taught herself to cook. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_digital\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-inline-square\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:150735422; alt=\"Silver Queen Corn Salad_credit Angie Mosier\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Gumbo is not the first thing I learned how to cook,” she said, “but it is the first thing I learned to master. So it has a lot of meaning for me.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her first restaurant, LuLu’s Sunset Grill on Weeks Bay, Alabama, she featured gumbo. “Gumbo was something special from my earliest memories of family love and togetherness, and now here it was, paying my bills, making my customers happy, feeding my children,” she wrote in “Gumbo Love.” “People kept on coming for gumbo and the company and the atmosphere.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGumbo begins with roux, a combination of hot fat and flour that adds flavor and acts as a thickener. Then comes the Holy Trinity of New Orleans cuisine — chopped onions, celery and bell pepper — followed by stock, tomatoes for Creole-style gumbo and a long simmer. Seasonings are added, including chiles if you like it spicy. Chicken or sausage meat not too much later; seafood just a few minutes before serving, and finally chopped green onions and parsley or cilantro. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It takes courage to make a gumbo,” Buffett wrote, and indeed it does. Okra is used to thicken some gumbos, but cooked wrong, it can make a slimy, stringy mess. Roux is intimidating even for experienced cooks. Cooked at a high temperature that requires constant attention, it is brought just to the edge of burning. Done right, roux adds a lovely, toasty flavor. A few seconds too long and it burns, its flavor scorched and bitter. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Roux takes practice,” says Buffett, who writes about roux as if it were a person, a temperamental diva. It steams, it spits and leaves battle scars on a cook’s arms. “It’s kind of a rite of passage for Southern cooks.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuffett moved around a lot, learning the cooking styles of each place and developing her own takes on them, which she included in “Gumbo Love.” She lived in Key West with her brother, Jimmy Buffett (yes, \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e Jimmy Buffett), where the Cuban influence led her to include picadillo and black bean soup. She also included tres leches, in which she substituted buttermilk for heavy cream, giving the cake tanginess to offset the heavy sweetness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom New Orleans, inspired by the muffaletta sandwich, she created recipes for a chopped muffaletta salad (salami, ham, Italian sausage, provolone, olives, pickled vegetables) and muffaletta sliders, made with tubes of Pillsbury French bread dough cut into roll-size pieces. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_digital\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-inline-square\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:150735397; alt=\"Day-After Brisket Po' Boy_credit Angie Mosier\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe developed recipes for many of the fish pulled from the Gulf: grouper with balsamic butter glaze, bronzed yellowtail snapper with citrus beurre blanc sauce, scampi amandine and crabmeat au gratin. True to Southern traditions, many of the recipes use lots of butter or cream, but Buffett notes: “I did put some healthy choices in there.” One of them is red snapper Veracruz, from a port city on Mexico’s Gulf Coast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe tested about 10 of her recipes, starting with her signature seafood gumbo, which was delicious. Other favorites: shrimp and crab dip, pimento cheese (next time I’ll add more hot sauce and worry less about finding a specialty beer), corn salad (another healthy choice), pasta with crawfish cream sauce (I substituted shrimp for crawfish), and a traditional buttermilk chess pie jazzed up with orange zest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_digital\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-inline-square\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:150735427; alt=\"pimento cheese\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, I liked the variety of choices in “Gumbo Love” and the way Buffett strung together her favorites from a region already well-loved for its cuisine. Some recipes were complicated and some were simple, but all were easy to follow and more accessible than those in many cookbooks by celebrity chefs or big-name restaurants. Many of those we tested felt like comfort food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’m not fancy and I’m self-taught. I don’t consider myself a gourmet chef,” Buffett said. But her food is good, and to make it, home cooks don’t need to be gourmet chefs, either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_endnote_contrib\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarjie Lambert is local government editor of the Miami Herald and author of eight cookbooks.

Remove the cores and coarsely chop the tomatoes over a bowl to retain juice. If using canned tomatoes, chop each tomato into eighths and return them to the juice in the can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make the roux, in a large stockpot (about 10 quarts), heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, gradually add the flour, whisking continuously, and cook, stirring and adjusting the heat as necessary to keep it from burning, until the roux is a dark mahogany color, 25 to 35 minutes,. Be careful: If the roux burns, you will have to start all over again!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarefully add the onion to the roux and stir with a large wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes. (The onion will sizzle and steam when it hits the hot roux, so caution is advised.

Stir in the salt, black pepper, cayenne, thyme, bay leaves, oregano, basil, Creole seasoning, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well. Bring the gumbo to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to maintain a slow simmer. Simmer, uncovered, for about 1 hour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdd the okra and bring the gumbo to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to maintain a slow simmer and cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until the okra has lost its bright green color and cooked down like the other vegetables. If the gumbo gets too thick, add a little water. If it is too thin, continue to simmer it, uncovered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGumbo is always better in the days after it has been cooked, although I’ve never had a complaint when I served it the day I made it. At this point, you can cool the gumbo. Turn off the heat and let it sit about 30 minutes. Then place the pot, uncovered, in an empty sink. Fill the sink with cold water and ice around the stockpot (try not to get any in the stockpot itself). Stir every 15 minutes to facilitate cooling. (The gumbo will spoil if improperly cooled.) When completely cool, refrigerate the gumbo in the stockpot, uncovered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen ready to serve, slowly bring the gumbo to a simmer over medium-low heat. Thirty minutes before serving, add the green onion, parsley and lemon juice to the gumbo. Cover and cook for 15 minutes. Add the shrimp and crabmeat, mix well and cook for 2 minutes. Cover and turn off the heat. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes more to cook the seafood. The gumbo will stay hot for a long time. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Taste and adjust the seasonings; serve over cooked white rice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
