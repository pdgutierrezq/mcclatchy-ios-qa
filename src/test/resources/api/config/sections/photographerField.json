McCarron came to the Bills this year as a free agent after spending his first four NFL seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals.<br/><br/></p><p style=\"margin: 12pt 0in;\">The only other QB on the roster is Nathan Peterman, who threw five interceptions last season in a start against San Diego. The Bills traded three-year starter Tyrod Taylor to Cleveland last month.</p><p style=\"margin: 12pt 0in;\">Before the draft, new Buffalo general manager Brando Beane had said that \"one of the main jobs of a GM is to find a franchise quarterback.\"</p><p style=\"margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left: 0in\">The Bills hadn't invested in quarterbacks lately: Their last first-round QB was EJ Manuel in 2013.<br/><br/></p><p><!-- %asset:209946694% --></p><p style=\"margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left: 0in\">Allen passed for more than 3,000 yards his senior season at Firebaugh High but <a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/marek-warszawski/article209811029.html\" target=\"_self\">didn't attract much college attention</a> until he grew into his 6-foot-5 frame during his one season at Reedley College.</p><p style=\"margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left: 0in\">Even then, only Wyoming and Eastern Michigan were the only FBS schools to offer a scholarship.</p><p style=\"margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left: 0in\">He chose Wyoming and, after a broken collarbone cut short his 2015 season, put together two impressive years for the Cowboys. In particular, he showed off a rifle arm that wowed NFL scouts.</p><p style=\"margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left: 0in\">He completed 56 percent of his passes for 3,203 yards and 28 touchdowns to 15 interceptions in 14 games as a sophomore. Then in 11 games this past season, Allen had a 56.3 completion percentage with 1,812 yards and 16 touchdowns to six picks as a junior.</p><p style=\"margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left: 0in\"><!-- %asset:209401344% --><br/><br/></p><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: 16pt; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Allen is the latest player with ties to the central San Joaquin Valley to be selected in the first round. </p><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: 16pt; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Former College of the Sequoias defensive end <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/player/sheldonrichardson/2540142/profile\" target=\"_self\">Sheldon Richardson went No. 13 overall</a> to the New York Jets in 2013.</p><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: 16pt; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Fresno State running back Ryan Mathews went No. 12 overall to the Chargers in 2010.</p><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: 16pt; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Other previous first-round picks out of Fresno State are: Logan Mankins (2005), David Carr (2002), Trent Dilfer (1994) and JD Williams (1990).</p><p>Raiders quarterback and Bulldogs great Derek Carr was notably taken <a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/david-white/article19519998.html\" target=\"_self\">in the second round in 2014</a>.</p><p></p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Bryant-Jon Anteola: <a href=\"tel:559-441-6362\">559-441-6362</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Banteola_TheBee\" target=\"_blank\">@Banteola_TheBee</a>.</div><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><em>Anthony Galaviz: <a href=\"tel:559-441-6042\">559-441-6042</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agalaviz_TheBee\" target=\"_blank\">@agalaviz_TheBee</a></em></div></div>",

Quit joshing us.</p><p>Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen and Baker Mayfield, the other projected first-round quarterbacks, went to USC, UCLA and Oklahoma, respectively. Marquee programs each. Allen played two seasons in the thin air and relative obscurity of Wyoming. Why? Because Wyoming and Eastern Michigan were the only FBS schools that offered him a scholarship.</p><p>“I was begging teams to give me a scholarship, sending emails out and hoping to hear back from them, and I got one opportunity,” Allen said during this year’s NFL scouting combine.</p><p>It looks so obvious now given Allen’s prototype size, arm strength, impressive mobility and intangibles. Watch him unleash a bolt of lightning to a sliver of the end zone, and yes of course he’s worthy of a nationally televised bear hug from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Except that sells short this young man’s journey (Allen turns 22 in May), one fueled by perseverance and self-belief.</p><p><!-- %asset:209825239; alt=\"EPZ JOSHALLEN 04\"% --></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><p>Had Allen listened to the doubters, the ones who said he was too small to play FBS and questioned the level of competition he’d faced, he’d probably be in the family farming business (dad Joel Allen owns 1,000 acres outside Firebaugh planted with cotton, wheat and cantaloupe) instead of poised to receive a seven-figure signing bonus for slinging spirals.</p><p>Instead, Allen tuned out the noise and never allowed his confidence to waver. Which is part source of inspiration and part valuable lesson.</p><p>“It’s tough when you think you’re good enough and sometimes even know you’re good enough to be at the next level and college coaches aren’t reaching out to you,” Allen said last week during an <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/sports/nfl/article209401344.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">appearance at the Firebaugh High gym</a>, a building named after his late grandfather, A.E. “Buzz” Allen.</p><p>“If you really want something bad enough and you’re willing to work for it, you have to make sure your mind is completely set on your goal and your task at hand – and that doesn’t just go for sports.</p><p>“Throughout life if you have a goal in place, follow through with it. Don’t give up until it’s done. Don’t quit when things get hard. When it gets tough, you get tougher. When you get knocked down you get back up and keep going at it. That’s what I’ve known.”</p><p>Allen’s story contradicts so many established myths about what it takes to get to where he is. Let’s hope his example can help shatter three particularly false ones.</p><p><!-- %asset:209825244; alt=\"Wyoming Iowa Football(2)\"% --></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><h3>Myth No. 1: Young athletes should specialize in one sport<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Besides football, Allen played baseball and basketball throughout his time at Firebaugh High. (With that arm, professional baseball also was a serious option.) As a 6-year-old he competed on a local swim team. He played one year of youth soccer, and he was so good by the end of the year teammates were calling him “Pele.”</p><p>Playing several sports made Allen a more well-rounded athlete, and person.</p><h3>Myth No. 2: The bigger the competition, the better<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Transfers in high school sports have become an epidemic, especially now that the California Interscholastic Federation <a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/sports/high-school/article145608659.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">permits athletically motivated moves</a>. Coaches tell me the impact on smaller schools has been disproportionately large.</p><p>Allen could have joined that trend. His parents could have found some excuse to send him to a larger school in Fresno or Clovis. Instead he remained in Firebaugh. Beating rival Mendota (which the Eagles did in Allen’s junior year) meant more to him than elevating his personal brand.</p><p>“My dad always told me you bloom where you’re planted,” Allen said. “So that’s what we did.”</p><p><!-- %asset:209362679% --></p><h3>Myth No. 3: Avoid the community college route<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>The stigma couldn’t be more wrong, because community colleges provide an excellent launch pad. Without that one semester at Reedley College, which happened to coincide with a growth spurt, Allen never would have been discovered. </p><p>But even future first-round picks have to be patient, which is a lesson in itself. Allen wasn’t named the Tigers’ starting quarterback to begin the 2014 season. Until week 4, the job belonged to Sean Stell Jr.</p><p>“We have guys here that quit after one week if they’re not named the starter,” Reedley coach Eric Marty pointed out during Allen’s <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/sports/article209362679.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recent campus visit</a>.</p><p>The lesson here, for young athletes with big dreams following in Allen’s footsteps and for their scholarship-hungry parents, is that if you’re good enough and work hard enough and persevere enough, colleges will find you. Even if you grow up in a two-stoplight town with no McDonald’s like Firebaugh.</p><p>“If there’s anybody, any kid out there that is from a small community that anybody’s telling them … they can’t do it, I hope that they can look at my story and find a source of inspiration and just know that it is possible,” he said.</p><p>No matter which NFL team drafts Allen, with a new fan base eager to adopt him, he’ll always be rooted in the Valley. His storybook success is ours, too.</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p><em>Marek Warszawski: 559-441-6218, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarekTheBee\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">@MarekTheBee</a></em></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><div class=\"ng_factbox\"><div class=\"ng_factbox_head\"><p>Josh Allen by the numbers</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p><strong>Height:</strong> 6-foot-5</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 237 pounds</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p><p><strong>WYOMING</strong></p><div class=\"ng_z_idx_alfa\"><p><strong>2017:</strong> 56.3 completion percentage; 1,812 yards (164.7 per game); <span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"240\"> </span></p><p>16 touchdowns; 6 interceptions</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p><strong>2016: </strong>56.0 comp. %; 3,203 yards (228.8 per game); 28 TDs; 15 INTs</p><p><strong>2015:</strong> 4 for 6 in two games before suffering a broken collarbone, 51 yards</p><p><strong>REEDLEY COLLEGE</strong></p><p><strong>2014:</strong> 49.0 comp. %; 2,055 yards; 26 TDs; 5 INTs</p><p><strong>FIREBAUGH HIGH</strong></p><p><strong>2013:</strong> 57.4 comp. %; 3,061 yards (255.1 per game); 33 TDs; 5 INTs</p><p><strong>2012:</strong> 50.8 comp. %; 2,208 yards (200.7 per game); 26 TDs; 10 INTs</p></div></div>",

                "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The NFL Draft is just around the corner. Finally.</p><p>After months of dissecting college film and putting prospects through rigorous workouts, teams will show their poker hands when the draft gets underway Thursday <a href=\"http://attstadium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">at AT&T Stadium</a>, home of the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>McClatchy’s Star-Telegram in Fort Worth, Texas, has been tracking the latest on draft prospects since last season. Here’s the first round in its Mock Draft 3.0, published Sunday:</p><p><strong>1. Cleveland Browns. Josh Allen, QB, Wyoming. </strong>Sam Darnold slips from the top spot he occupied since the Star-Telegram produced its first mock draft March 8. There’s just too many whispers going around on <a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/sports/nfl/article209265119.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Allen, the Firebaugh native who also played one season at Reedley College</a>, to the Browns, and that’s too hard to ignore. General manager John Dorsey needs to use this pick on whoever he believes will become a franchise quarterback. (Many mock drafts have elevated Allen to No. 1.)</p><p><!-- %asset:209401344% --></p><p><strong>2. New York Giants. Saquon Barkley, RB, Penn State.</strong> Same as before. The smart long-term play mighty be taking a quarterback, but the Giants could become playoff contenders again with the addition of Barkley. This is a team that ranked 26th in rushing offense a season ago.</p><p><strong>3. New York Jets. Sam Darnold, QB, USC. </strong>The Jets land the quarterback who’s widely considered the “safest” QB choice in this year’s class. They hope Darnold lives up to the hype.</p><p><strong>4. Cleveland Browns. Bradley Chubb, DE, North Carolina State. </strong>The Browns benefit by the Colts trading out of the No. 3 spot. Chubb is the best pass rusher in this draft and would form a dream pass rush tandem with Myles Garrett.</p><p><strong>5. Denver Broncos. Baker Mayfield, QB, Oklahoma. </strong>Case Keenum is the starter for the immediate future, and this provides a perfect breeding ground for the reigning Heisman Trophy winner.</p><p><strong>6. Indianapolis Colts. Quenton Nelson, G, Notre Dame. </strong>Arguably the best player in the draft; the Colts get Andrew Luck more inside protection.</p><p><strong>7. Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Minkah Fitzpatrick, DB, Alabama. </strong>A Day 1 starter at safety will help a secondary that ranked last in pass defense, allowing 260.6 yards a game.</p><p><strong>8. Chicago Bears. Denzel Ward, CB, Ohio State. </strong>Shutdown corners don’t grow on trees, and Ward has the makings of being just that at the next level.</p><p><strong>9. San Francisco 49ers. Derwin James, S, Florida State. </strong>He’s drawn comparisons to Sean Taylor and Ed Reed. Oh, and 49ers general manager John Lynch knows a thing or two about safety play.</p><p><strong>10. Oakland Raiders. Tremaine Edmunds, LB, Virginia Tech. </strong>At just 19, Edmunds is going to be the youngest player in the NFL. But he’s an elite athlete and should become a staple at the start of the Jon Gruden era.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/topics/nfl-draft\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><strong>NFL DRAFT GUIDE FROM THE STAR-TELEGRAM</strong></a></p><p><strong>11. Miami Dolphins. Vita Vea, DT, Washington.</strong> Ndamukong Suh is gone. Enter Vea, a massive run-stuffing defensive tackle.</p><p><strong>12. Buffalo Bills. Josh Rosen, QB, UCLA. </strong>The Bills might have to trade into the top-five to get their quarterback of choice. But Rosen slides to them in this scenario.</p><p><strong>13. Washington Redskins. Roquan Smith, LB, Georgia. </strong>Smith is a top-10 talent the Redskins would love to see fall to them. This would be an easy pick.</p><p><strong>14. Green Bay Packers. Harold Landry, OLB, Boston College. </strong>Landry had a disappointing season as a senior in 2017, but he still has the makings of being an elite edge rusher at the next level. The Packers gamble on him over UTSA’s Marcus Davenport.</p><p><strong>15. Arizona Cardinals. Lamar Jackson, QB, Louisville. </strong>With no disrespect to Sam Bradford, the Cardinals need to find a future quarterback, and Jackson has upside. New coach Steve Wilks came from Carolina and could see Jackson in a similar light as Cam Newton.</p><p><strong>16. Baltimore Ravens. Calvin Ridley, WR, Alabama.</strong> The Ravens had one of the worst passing offenses last season. Quarterback Joe Flacco needs more weapons and lands the top receiving talent in this class.</p><p><strong>17. Los Angeles Chargers. Mason Rudolph, QB, Oklahoma State.</strong> Rudolph has worked out with Philip Rivers this off-season and <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/college/football/article202193064.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">would love to study under him</a>. Why not make it happen with Rivers turning 37 this season?</p><p><strong>18. Seattle Seahawks. Josh Jackson, CB, Iowa.</strong> The “Legion of Boom” appears to be a thing of the past, but Jackson could be part of the next era. He had 27 passes defended and eight interceptions for the Hawkeyes last season.</p><p><strong>19. Dallas Cowboys. Leighton Vander Esch, LB, Boise State. </strong>Yes, wide receiver is a need, but the team addresses it in Round 2. They opt for a linebacker who adds depth to a unit that has been injury-riddled.</p><p><strong>20. Detroit Lions. Da’Ron Payne, DT, Alabama.</strong> Payne is the best player on the board at this point and is a talent in the trenches who will help every level of the defense. He also has flexibility if Matt Patricia is running a 3-4 or 4-3.</p><p><strong>21. Cincinnati Bengals. James Daniels, C, Iowa.</strong> Daniels is the best center in this class and maybe since Pro Bowler Alex Mack in 2009. He has versatility to start at any three of the interior line positions and will help the Bengals immediately.</p><p><strong>22. Buffalo Bills. Mike McGlinchey, OT, Notre Dame. </strong>They traded away Cordy Glenn to the Bengals and fill that void with a player, McGlinchey, who can be a Day 1 starter at right or left tackle.</p><p><strong>23. New England Patriots. Kolton Miller, OT, UCLA. </strong>Nate Solder bolted in free agency and the Patriots address that with a pick acquired in the Brandin Cooks trade. Miller isn’t the cleanest prospect, but has the makings of becoming an elite left tackle in the pros.</p><p><strong>24. Carolina Panthers. Justin Reid, S, Stanford. </strong>The Panthers released Kurt Coleman, and Reid would step in as a Day 1 starter. He is a versatile player who had five interceptions last season for the Cardinal.</p><p><strong>25. Tennessee Titans. Marcus Davenport, DE, Texas-San Antonio.</strong> Derrick Morgan and Brian Orakpo are set to become free agents after this season, and Davenport could develop into an elite rusher after piling up 15 sacks the past two seasons at UTSA.</p><p><strong>26. Atlanta Falcons. Taven Bryan, DT, Florida. </strong>Bryan has drawn comparisons to Philadelphia’s Fletcher Cox. A prospect with that much upside has to entice a coach such as Dan Quinn, who spent time at Florida as the defensive coordinator and D-line coach in 2011-12.</p><p><strong>27. New Orleans Saints. Mike Gesicki, TE, Penn State.</strong> Drew Brees gets another weapon in hopes of making another push for a championship. After failing to bring back Jimmy Graham, Gesicki gives the Saints a big target at 6-foot-5, 247 pounds, especially in the red zone. It also doesn’t hurt that he tied for first in the 40-yard dash (4.54 seconds) among tight ends at the Combine.</p><p><strong>28. Pittsburgh Steelers. Rashaan Evans, LB, Alabama. </strong>A physical linebacker with power and speed who had 13 tackles for loss last season. Evans makes sense for the Steelers, particularly after the scary spinal injury Ryan Shazier sustained last year.</p><p><strong>29. Jacksonville Jaguars. D.J. Moore, WR, Maryland. </strong>The Jaguars didn’t have a 1,000-yard receiver, and the leader in touchdown receptions was veteran tight end Marcedes Lewis with five. They need more playmakers for Blake Bortles.</p><p><strong>30. Minnesota Vikings. Connor Williams, OT, Texas. </strong>The have to protect their biggest investment, Kirk Cousins, and <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-texas/article203156899.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Williams is versatile enough to play guard or tackle</a>. That’s good for a team that saw longtime right guard Joe Berger retire last month.</p><p><strong>31. New England Patriots. Jaire Alexander, CB, Louisville.</strong> Alexander is a corner with speed and ball skills. He’s certainly a suitable replacement for Malcolm Butler (who is now with the Titans).</p><p><strong>32. Philadelphia Eagles. Derrius Guice, LSU. </strong>The Eagles have a stocked roster and add another playmaker to their offense in Guice, who was among the Eagles’ pre-draft visits. Guice provides stability at running back, too, with Jay Ajayi entering the final year of his contract in 2018.</p><div class=\"ng_factbox\"><div class=\"ng_factbox_head\"><p>Josh Allen by the numbers</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p><strong>Height:</strong> 6-foot-5</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 237 pounds</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p><p><strong>WYOMING</strong></p><p><strong>2017:</strong> 56.3 completion percentage, 1,812 yards (164.7 per game), 16 touchdowns, 6 interceptions</p><p><strong>2016: </strong>56.0 completion percentage, 3,203 yards (228.8 per game), 28 TDs, 15 interceptions</p><p><strong>2015:</strong> 4 for 6 in two games before suffering a broken collarbone, 51 yards, 0 TDs, 0 interceptions</p><p><strong>REEDLEY COLLEGE</strong></p><p><strong>2014:</strong> 49.0 completion percentage, 2,055 yards, 26 TDs, 5 interceptions</p><p><strong>FIREBAUGH HIGH</strong></p><p><strong>2013: </strong>57.4 completion percentage, 3,061 yards (255.1 per game), 33 TDs, 5 interceptions</p><p><strong>2012:</strong> 50.8 completion percentage, 2,208 yards (200.7 per game), 26 TDs, 10 interceptions</p></div></div>",

He played 10 games for the Tigers and completed 127 of 259 for 2,055 yards and 26 touchdowns against five interceptions. Allen also had 120 carries for 660 yards and 10 touchdowns in his lone season at Reedley.</p><p>Thursday morning, he did a Q&A with Reedley College student-athletes. “I get to come back and share an experience with them,” Allen said. “Hopefully ... they take that and use it for their own good.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p><em>Anthony Galaviz: <a href=\"tel:559-441-6042\">559-441-6042</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agalaviz_TheBee\" target=\"_blank\">@agalaviz_TheBee</a></em></p><span class=\"ng-command\"></span></div></div>",

He would relish it and is hopeful the Cleveland Browns view him as the top quarterback in this year’s class.</p><p>“I would love to have that pressure on my shoulders because I’ve always thrived in those situations,” Allen said on Tuesday. “I feel like Cleveland would be a great spot to be. But, if I’m not, I’m not, and I’m going to do whatever I can to the team that actually picks me and actually wants me so we’ll go from there.”</p><p>The Browns are expected to use the No. 1 pick on a quarterback when the draft gets underway Thursday at AT&T Stadium. (5 p.m. Pacific time, FOX)</p><p>There have been rumblings that Allen could be Cleveland’s top target, although there’s plenty of competition. Some believe USC’s Sam Darnold would be the safest pick, while others feel the Browns should roll the dice on Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield.</p><p>But Allen is certainly in the conversation and had pre-draft visits with seven teams, including Cleveland, New York Giants, New York Jets and Buffalo. The Wyoming quarterback has arguably the best arm in the class, but his accuracy has been questioned.</p><p>Allen completed just 56.3 percent of his passes last season, throwing for 1,812 yards with 16 TDs and six interceptions. Still, his impressive arm strength could land him as the top overall pick.</p><p>As far as the critics are concerned, Allen has done his best at blocking them out.</p><p>“It doesn’t bother me one way or another. Everybody’s got their own opinion and their own say,” Allen said. “In today’s age, everybody wants to be right. So there’s people that hate you, there’s people that love you. I’m going to go out there and play my game, and whatever team is fortunate to pick me, or I’m fortunate to be picked by, is going to be a team I’m going to give everything to. Hopefully I’ll be there for the next 15 years.</p><p>“It’s an exciting time, but at this moment right now I’m content with whatever happens. My job is done and now it’s just sitting back and hearing my name being called.”</p><p>Allen spent Tuesday at the Cowboys’ practice facility known as The Star. He took part in an event with Cowboys tight end Jason Witten, as well as fellow draft hopefuls Minkah Fitzpatrick, Shaquem Griffin and Mason Rudolph.</p><p>The event supported Witten’s “The Score Foundation” and partnered with J.C. Penney to emphasize the importance of leadership on and off the field. The players received a custom suit from COLLECTION by Michael Strahan, which is sold exclusively at J.C. Penney.</p><p>Allen soaked it all in, spending time with Witten.</p><p>“Maybe the best tight end to ever play the game,” Allen said. “You just hear how good of a person he is from around the league and from different people. To model yourself after one person on and off the field, not just as a tight end or a football player, but just as a human being is definitely someone you can draw inspiration from.”</p><h3>From Firebaugh to NFL<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Allen hopes to become a similar role model in whatever community he finds himself in by Thursday. He reflected back on his journey, too, going from Firebaugh to Wyoming to the NFL.</p><p>He credited Firebaugh with laying the foundation for his success.</p><p>“Firebaugh kind of taught me everything I know as a person,” Allen said. “The hard work. The dedication that it takes. We’re a group of hard-working people down there and it’s something that I hold near and dear to my heart, just where I come from and the type of people that come from there. You see me as a person that kind of reflects the town.”</p><p>Allen is ready for his draft day moment. He’ll be joined alongside several family members and his college coaches Thursday night.</p><p>“It’s going to be a good day for the Allen family and I think the city of Firebaugh and the whole Central Valley and the state of Wyoming,” Allen said. “There’re a lot of people behind me and I’m extremely blessed to have the support that I do.”</p></div>",

          "summary": "From the cantaloupe fields of Firebaugh to Reedley College to Wyoming to potential No. 1 overall NFL draft pick, quarterback Josh Allen's story is one of perseverance and self-belief. Here's what we can learn from it.",
          "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>If Josh Allen didn’t actually walk among us, all 6 feet, 5 inches, 237 pounds and 10⅛-inch hands of him, you’d swear he sprang from a screenwriter’s notepad.</p><p>His story could hardly be more storybook. A late-sprouter from the cantaloupe fields of Firebaugh, <a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/marek-warszawski/article122086499.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">ignored by college coaches</a> out of high school, who didn’t even start right away at Reedley College, is <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2018/04/josh_allen_and_baker_mayfield.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">on the shortlist</a> to be the <a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/sports/nfl/article209761614.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">No. 1 overall pick</a> of the Cleveland Browns in Thursday’s NFL draft. </p><p>C’mon, Josh. Quit joshing us.</p><p>Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen and Baker Mayfield, the other projected first-round quarterbacks, went to USC, UCLA and Oklahoma, respectively. Marquee programs each. Allen played two seasons in the thin air and relative obscurity of Wyoming. Why? Because Wyoming and Eastern Michigan were the only FBS schools that offered him a scholarship.</p><p>“I was begging teams to give me a scholarship, sending emails out and hoping to hear back from them, and I got one opportunity,” Allen said during this year’s NFL scouting combine.</p><p>It looks so obvious now given Allen’s prototype size, arm strength, impressive mobility and intangibles. Watch him unleash a bolt of lightning to a sliver of the end zone, and yes of course he’s worthy of a nationally televised bear hug from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Except that sells short this young man’s journey (Allen turns 22 in May), one fueled by perseverance and self-belief.</p><p><!-- %asset:209825239; alt=\"EPZ JOSHALLEN 04\"% --></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><p>Had Allen listened to the doubters, the ones who said he was too small to play FBS and questioned the level of competition he’d faced, he’d probably be in the family farming business (dad Joel Allen owns 1,000 acres outside Firebaugh planted with cotton, wheat and cantaloupe) instead of poised to receive a seven-figure signing bonus for slinging spirals.</p><p>Instead, Allen tuned out the noise and never allowed his confidence to waver. Which is part source of inspiration and part valuable lesson.</p><p>“It’s tough when you think you’re good enough and sometimes even know you’re good enough to be at the next level and college coaches aren’t reaching out to you,” Allen said last week during an <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/sports/nfl/article209401344.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">appearance at the Firebaugh High gym</a>, a building named after his late grandfather, A.E. “Buzz” Allen.</p><p>“If you really want something bad enough and you’re willing to work for it, you have to make sure your mind is completely set on your goal and your task at hand – and that doesn’t just go for sports.</p><p>“Throughout life if you have a goal in place, follow through with it. Don’t give up until it’s done. Don’t quit when things get hard. When it gets tough, you get tougher. When you get knocked down you get back up and keep going at it. That’s what I’ve known.”</p><p>Allen’s story contradicts so many established myths about what it takes to get to where he is. Let’s hope his example can help shatter three particularly false ones.</p><p><!-- %asset:209825244; alt=\"Wyoming Iowa Football(2)\"% --></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><h3>Myth No. 1: Young athletes should specialize in one sport<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Besides football, Allen played baseball and basketball throughout his time at Firebaugh High. (With that arm, professional baseball also was a serious option.) As a 6-year-old he competed on a local swim team. He played one year of youth soccer, and he was so good by the end of the year teammates were calling him “Pele.”</p><p>Playing several sports made Allen a more well-rounded athlete, and person.</p><h3>Myth No. 2: The bigger the competition, the better<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>Transfers in high school sports have become an epidemic, especially now that the California Interscholastic Federation <a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/sports/high-school/article145608659.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">permits athletically motivated moves</a>. Coaches tell me the impact on smaller schools has been disproportionately large.</p><p>Allen could have joined that trend. His parents could have found some excuse to send him to a larger school in Fresno or Clovis. Instead he remained in Firebaugh. Beating rival Mendota (which the Eagles did in Allen’s junior year) meant more to him than elevating his personal brand.</p><p>“My dad always told me you bloom where you’re planted,” Allen said. “So that’s what we did.”</p><p><!-- %asset:209362679% --></p><h3>Myth No. 3: Avoid the community college route<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></h3><p>The stigma couldn’t be more wrong, because community colleges provide an excellent launch pad. Without that one semester at Reedley College, which happened to coincide with a growth spurt, Allen never would have been discovered. </p><p>But even future first-round picks have to be patient, which is a lesson in itself. Allen wasn’t named the Tigers’ starting quarterback to begin the 2014 season. Until week 4, the job belonged to Sean Stell Jr.</p><p>“We have guys here that quit after one week if they’re not named the starter,” Reedley coach Eric Marty pointed out during Allen’s <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/sports/article209362679.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recent campus visit</a>.</p><p>The lesson here, for young athletes with big dreams following in Allen’s footsteps and for their scholarship-hungry parents, is that if you’re good enough and work hard enough and persevere enough, colleges will find you. Even if you grow up in a two-stoplight town with no McDonald’s like Firebaugh.</p><p>“If there’s anybody, any kid out there that is from a small community that anybody’s telling them … they can’t do it, I hope that they can look at my story and find a source of inspiration and just know that it is possible,” he said.</p><p>No matter which NFL team drafts Allen, with a new fan base eager to adopt him, he’ll always be rooted in the Valley. His storybook success is ours, too.</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p><em>Marek Warszawski: 559-441-6218, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarekTheBee\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">@MarekTheBee</a></em></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><div class=\"ng_factbox\"><div class=\"ng_factbox_head\"><p>Josh Allen by the numbers</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p><strong>Height:</strong> 6-foot-5</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 237 pounds</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p><p><strong>WYOMING</strong></p><div class=\"ng_z_idx_alfa\"><p><strong>2017:</strong> 56.3 completion percentage; 1,812 yards (164.7 per game); <span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"240\"> </span></p><p>16 touchdowns; 6 interceptions</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p><strong>2016: </strong>56.0 comp. %; 3,203 yards (228.8 per game); 28 TDs; 15 INTs</p><p><strong>2015:</strong> 4 for 6 in two games before suffering a broken collarbone, 51 yards</p><p><strong>REEDLEY COLLEGE</strong></p><p><strong>2014:</strong> 49.0 comp. %; 2,055 yards; 26 TDs; 5 INTs</p><p><strong>FIREBAUGH HIGH</strong></p><p><strong>2013:</strong> 57.4 comp. %; 3,061 yards (255.1 per game); 33 TDs; 5 INTs</p><p><strong>2012:</strong> 50.8 comp. %; 2,208 yards (200.7 per game); 26 TDs; 10 INTs</p></div></div>",

He blossomed in two seasons playing for the Cowboys and now stands ready to start his pro career.</p><p><!-- %asset:209357839% --></p><p>“Now that it’s here, I’m enjoying the process and my family is enjoying it,” he said Thursday. “Now it’s wait to see where I’m going to play and give that franchise everything I have.”</p><p>At Firebaugh High, Allen spoke in a packed gymnasium as students cheered for one of their own who is a budding national star.</p><p>Former Eagles football coach Bill Magnusson and boys basketball coach Jim McCall welcomed Allen and wished him the best moving forward.</p><p>The Allen family will spend the weekend in Firebaugh and play golf on Sunday before departing for Texas on Tuesday. </p><p>Allen will find out which NFL team he’s headed to when the NFL Draft starts April 26 at 5 p.m. PDT. ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. projects Allen to be the top overall pick by the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing for sure about the draft. Allen has visited seven teams in the past 10 days.</p><p>It’s part of a whirlwind April that also saw him make an appearance at, of all places, the Masters golf tournament where he met with Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, the 2016 NFL MVP. Allen said he and Ryan talked about football and life.</p><p>“I’ve always thought the NFL could happen,” Allen said Thursday morning at Reedley College. “It’s the only thing I’ve ever wanted to happen.</p><p>“Getting the opportunity to play here at Reedley was a blessing for me. It’s the first time I’ve been back since I played here. It’s really cool to be out here and see the support.”</p><p><!-- %asset:209362679% --></p><p>Allen was at Reedley in 2014, getting his first start in Week 5 against Fresno City College. He played 10 games for the Tigers and completed 127 of 259 for 2,055 yards and 26 touchdowns against five interceptions. Allen also had 120 carries for 660 yards and 10 touchdowns in his lone season at Reedley.</p><p>Thursday morning, he did a Q&A with Reedley College student-athletes. “I get to come back and share an experience with them,” Allen said. “Hopefully ... they take that and use it for their own good.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p><em>Anthony Galaviz: <a href=\"tel:559-441-6042\">559-441-6042</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agalaviz_TheBee\" target=\"_blank\">@agalaviz_TheBee</a></em></p><span class=\"ng-command\"></span></div></div>",

If he were to fall in the draft (due to a massive amount of negative attention, for example), he could be picked up by another team.</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\">Joshua Tehee: <a href=\"tel:559-441-6479\">559-441-6479</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaTehee\" target=\"_blank\">@joshuatehee</a></div></div>",
