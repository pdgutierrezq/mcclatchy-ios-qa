        "summary": "Synthetic marijuana — known as K2 — heroin and other drugs are easy to get in Florida prisons. A recent spike in inmate deaths has been associated with overdoses.",
        "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Meal times at Tomoka Correctional Institution Work Camp look like a scene straight out of the “Walking Dead,” a former employee of 10 years told the Miami Herald.</p><p>“Everywhere you turn, inmates are walking around like zombies,” said officer Keith Raimundo, who quit in June amid disagreements with the administration and mounting frustrations with how the facility was run. “Every other inmate coming into the chow hall is high.”</p><p>The scene at the mess hall follows a predictable script, Raimundo told the Herald: Red-eyed inmates shuffle in to get their dinner and sit down to eat, uncoordinated limbs struggling to place food in their mouths. Frequently, he said, someone “falls out,” common vernacular for an overdose. The inmate might faceplant unconscious into his food tray, or slip from his seat, foaming at the mouth, twitching, all of his muscles seizing. At Tomoka, it’s too common an occurrence to be alarming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"></span></p><p>“Everybody thinks it’s funny,” said Raimundo. That includes the inmates and officers, he said.</p><p>But it’s not funny. It’s deadly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> And it’s not just Tomoka.</span></p><p>“It is a statewide issue. The number of incidents at Tomoka is not disproportionate with the rest of the state,” said FDC spokesperson Michelle Glady in a statement.</p><p>The past two years have each been the deadliest in Florida prison history, consecutively. And 2018 figures to be worse yet. Total deaths this year are on track to exceed 500 for the first time, a previously unthinkable threshold. And every year, more younger people are dying. The spike in mortality is paralleled by a dramatic rise in “accidental deaths,” up from 12 in 2016 to 62 in 2017. Those are mostly drug overdoses, according to the department. </p><p>The top killer, according to an internal FDC audit: synthetic marijuana, more commonly called K2 or Spice. It’s the same drug that just made national headlines when 70 people overdosed in 24 hours in New Haven, Conn., home of Yale University.</p><p class=\"p1\"><!-- %asset:216545635; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p class=\"p1\">Synthetic marijuana is a misnomer, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. While synthetic cannabinoids are supposed to trigger the same receptors in the brain as THC, the naturally occurring component in marijuana that produces a high, the chemical makeup of K2 is unique from traditional marijuana. Unlike its natural counterpart, synthetic marijuana can cause aggressive behavior, hallucinations, heart attacks, seizures like the ones Raimundo described as “falling out,” and death.<br/><br/></p><p>“That stuff is killing people left and right,” Raimundo said.</p><p>There is no single chemical makeup of synthetic marijuana, so in practice, it can be made of almost anything. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>In prison, it often contains traces of roach spray and rat poison.</p><p>“There are dozens of different chemicals that are used as synthetic cannabinoids,” said Dr. Tegan Boehmer, of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health. “They are very dangerous because there are a lot of unknowns.”</p><p>The few death investigation summaries made available online by the department offer a partial glimpse of the problem. Last year, at Franklin Correctional Institution, Eugene Martin fell forward suddenly out of bed, dead from K2. At Mayo Correctional Institution, Hakim Ramatoola had a seizure and died after smoking K2 described by others who participated as<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>“the worst ever.” Jarquez Jones died at Santa Rosa after smoking an unusual-looking black K2. Jamil Wright overdosed at Martin Correctional. Ruben Harris and Calvin Johnson at Holmes Correctional Institution. Jesse Johnson at Okaloosa Correctional Institution. All in the last half of 2017. And the list goes on.</p><p>The department does not keep statistics on non-lethal overdoses. Still, it acknowledges that overdoses related to synthetic marijuana use have gotten so frequent in Florida prisons that the FDC created an informational video about the dangers of the drug and showed it to all 96,253 inmates. Incoming inmates now watch it as part of their intake process.</p><p> <!-- %asset:215668060% --> </p><p></p><p>Officials hoped more awareness of the deadly side effects would cause inmates to think twice before lighting up. </p><p>“It was a joke,” said Raimundo who spoke with Tomoka inmates about the video. “I don’t know if it really stopped anybody because they were laughing about it.”</p><p>Studies by the CDC note that synthetic cannabinoids can become addictive over time. “People can experience pretty severe withdrawal,” said Boehmer, who said the symptoms can be bad enough to need hospitalization.</p><p>“They couldn’t really function without it in their systems,” Raimundo said. </p><p>Prison isn’t fun. Inmates often struggle with boredom and mental health. Raimundo said, at Tomoka, “There’s absolutely nothing to do except get high.”</p><p>At Tomoka work camp, there are very few programs or structured activities. Even the handball court was removed, he said, leaving inmates with a single shabby basketball court as their only recreational activity. So, they sometimes turn to drugs to pass the time.</p><p>“Many of the inmates prefer using “K2” because the drug is undetectable on the FDC’s urinalysis drug-tests,” wrote an inmate who goes by “Jesse” on Instagram. He wrote testing positive for regular marijuana use could result in a disciplinary report, confinement (a form of isolation), loss of gain time, and even loss of visitation. He estimates one third of the inmates in his housing unit frequently use K2.</p><p><!-- %asset:216899275; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p class=\"p2\">Other than tobacco and home-brew alcohol, the most frequently encountered substances, K2 was the most common drug found in Florida prisons last year by a factor of 10. Nearly 60,000 grams — 132 pounds — were confiscated during fiscal year 2016/2017. (Think 132 of those bricks of marijuana you see in shows like “Narcos.”)</p><p class=\"p1\">The rise in synthetic marijuana use in Florida prisons also correlates with a rise in addictions to other substances, namely opioids like heroin. But as the numbers of addicts across the state increases, funding for addiction treatment programs for inmates has been slashed. The recent state budget left Florida prisons with a nearly <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article211957059.html\" target=\"_blank\">$50 million deficit</a>. In response to the shortfall, the department slashed treatment programs by $28 million.</p><p>The FDC reported that nearly <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article211957059.html\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent</a> of incoming inmates have a substance abuse problem. Inmates are screened for suspected substance abuse disorders at reception centers around the state. The screening involves answering 16 questions like “Have you EVER had a drinking or other drug problem?” and “Did you use alcohol or other drugs before you came to prison?”</p><p>Inmates who answer yes to three or more questions are screened for treatment or further evaluation. “Once they present at a treatment program, they’re fully assessed for a substance use disorder,” said FDC spokesperson Patrick Manderfield. </p><p>Tomoka does not offer addiction counseling or treatment of any kind, and hasn’t for years.</p><p>“Most of the time that’s what the inmates would say about why they were doing drugs in the jail — because there was no help to get them over their addictions from the outside,” said Raimundo, who said his post in mess hall often functioned like an office for ad-hoc therapy sessions when the inmates reached out to him to talk. “A lot of those guys aren’t bad people. A lot of them just have a lot of problems.”</p><p>Some inmates told Raimundo they wanted to get better — to quit — but they didn’t have the resources to help them. Some would break down and cry. He said they would usually say something like: “I don’t want my family getting that horrible phone call that I’m dead.”</p><p>Chelsey Douglas-Weiss got that call a little over one year ago, on July 27, 2017. It was about her dad. He had overdosed the night before at Tomoka.</p><p><!-- %asset:216545680; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>“I didn’t know how to feel. I thought it was a sick joke,” said Douglas-Weiss. A year later, “All I can think about is how much I want my dad back. My future is completely different because I saw my dad in it and now I don’t know what my future will become.”<br/><br/></p><p>Douglas-Weiss’s father, Harry Weiss, had spent much of her 18 years in prison, and Douglas-Weiss said he had always struggled with heroin and methamphetamine addictions. But, she says, he was committed to cleaning up his act this time. He spoke with his daughter over the phone, and frequently wrote her letters, apologizing, and taking ownership of his mistakes. </p><p>Weiss had a near spotless disciplinary record. On a Valentines Day note, Weiss wrote to his daughter:</p><p>“Sorry that I’ve never been the father I should have been but know no one could ever truly love you as much as me.” He drew a rose and a heart on an enclosed piece of paper.</p><p>Raimundo remembers Weiss as one of the good ones, a hard worker, and not one he saw seeking out drugs.</p><p>“He didn’t really give any problems,” said Raimundo. “I’d never seen him high, and I’m usually observant.”</p><p>On July 27, 2017, Weiss died of an overdose in the bathroom at Tomoka, according to what FDC told the family. The needle was still sticking out of his arm when he was found. The medical examiner found fentanyl, the strongest synthetic opioid on the market, in his system, which was listed as the cause of death.</p><p>What happened to Weiss was predictable. Without proper support and counseling, most inmates with addictions relapse when they gain access to drugs again, according to research published by Pew Charitable trust. “An addict’s tolerance for drugs is low but his craving to get high can be as strong as ever,” the article notes. That makes them especially susceptible to overdose. </p><p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">“Harry didn’t want to die,” said his mother, Phyllis Weiss. She said she had to use her Social Security to bring her son home to bury him. </span>Both heartbroken and angry, Phyllis Weiss wants answers. </p><p>“How did he get the needle in the bathroom? How did he get fentanyl in there? Who gave it to him?” she asked. </p><p>Heroin, cocaine, marijuana, K2, suboxone strips, and even some high-inducing eye drops are available for the right price at Tomoka, Raimundo said. He used to perform cell searches and write incident reports about all of the contraband he would find. That is, until he said the prison administration asked him to stop. </p><p>“They pretty much stopped me from searching [in May] because I find too much stuff,” Raimundo said. He said the high numbers were making the prison look bad in Tallahassee.</p><p>Stopping the searches, thus lowering the number of drugs documented within the prison facilities, was about controlling the optics in the state capital, he said. But at Tomoka, Raimundo said, the administration has given up on actually stemming the flow of contraband. He said his boss would tell him, “You can find whatever you want but they’ll just bring it in again the next day.”</p><p><!-- %asset:216921595; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>It’s true, Raimundo said, that inmates on work release, who leave the prison to work on highway cleanups or construction jobs, do have more access to drugs. But they are searched when they return to the prison, though he said it’s not always thorough. </p><p>Like all prisons in Florida, Tomoka is chronically understaffed, the low pay and long hours discouraging many potential applicants. It also creates low morale among overworked staff. Single officers can be responsible for entire dorms by themselves. Because the turnover rate is high, the majority of on-duty officers tend to be new and under-trained. Raimundo said it’s not uncommon for overworked corrections officers to look the other way when the inmates are smoking K2.</p><p>“They tell inmates they are leaving the dorm and if they are going to smoke, just don’t cause a problem,” Raimundo said. Again, records suggest that behavior is not limited to Tomoka officers.</p><p>A summary of a death investigation from Feb. 28, 2018, describes how 51-year-old Robert Bisson, an inmate at Columbia Correctional Institution, overdosed on K2 during what a fellow inmate — the prisoner assigned to the cell where Bisson died — described as a known nightly smoke session. He said he would excuse himself while others got high. The case summary, posted on the FDC website, gives no indication that staff and other inmates were quizzed about whether the cell was in fact a drug den. Nor did it explore how the K2 was introduced into the prison. The summary said “no administrative issues” were uncovered by the investigation. That’s common.</p><p>The low pay and low morale has another side effect. According to Raimundo, corrections officers are often the ones who smuggle the contraband in to sell to the inmates. </p><p><!-- %asset:216985740; alt=\"undefined\"% --></p><p>“These people are bringing stuff in. They’re compensating themselves,” said Raimundo. He said no amount of increased security measures will stop the flow of drugs so long as the person searching you is a buddy or in on the take.</p><p>“The department is using every tool available to prevent contraband from entering the institution and educating on the dangers of contraband,” Glady, the prison system spokeswoman, said. She said department added nine new K9 dogs to the interdiction unit this past fiscal year, and implemented “enhanced searches of visitors and staff” for what she termed “targeted contraband interdiction.”</p><p> In 2017, 18 officers across the state were arrested for introducing contraband into the prison system. None were from Tomoka.</p><p> <!-- %asset:217059430% --> </p></div>",

        "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Completed during Harry Truman’s presidency, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friant-Kern_Canal\" target=\"_blank\">Friant-Kern Canal</a> has been a workhorse in California’s elaborate man-made water-delivery network. It’s a low-tech concrete marvel that operates purely on gravity, capable of efficiently piping billions of gallons of water to cities and farms on a 152-mile journey along the east side of the fertile San Joaquin Valley.</p><p>Until now. </p><p>The Friant-Kern has been crippled by a <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/article31527953.html\" target=\"_blank\">phenomenon known as subsidence.</a> The canal is sinking as the Valley floor beneath it slowly caves in, brought down by years of groundwater extraction by the region’s farmers. </p><p>Along a 25-mile stretch of Tulare County rich with grapevines and pistachio trees, the canal has fallen so far — a dozen feet since it opened in 1951 — that it has lost more than half of its carrying capacity downstream from the choke point. Water simply can’t get through like it’s supposed to.</p><p>“It ponds up; you lose capacity and that ability to move water through the system,” said Douglas DeFlitch, chief operating officer at the Friant Water Authority. The authority operates the canal for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Central Valley Project.<br/><br/></p><p>Although subsidence has been a problem for decades, it accelerated as groundwater pumping expanded during the recent drought. Now it’s reaching a crisis point on the Friant-Kern, and California voters are being asked to fix it.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://waterbond.org/\" target=\"_blank\">proposition on the November ballot</a> would raise billions of dollars for a variety of water projects around the state, including roughly $350 million to repair the Friant-Kern. </p><p>Proposition sponsor Gerald Meral, a prominent environmentalist, said it’s in Californians’ interests to ensure the flow of water to the east side of the Valley. The Friant-Kern brings water to the city of Fresno, numerous small towns and 17,000 farmers.</p><p>“Keeping 1 million acres of land in the Friant service area (in production) is a public good,” said Meral, a former deputy secretary of the state Natural Resources Agency.<br/><br/></p><p>So far no organized opposition has emerged to Meral’s proposition.</p><p>The Friant-Kern’s woes illustrate the enduring nature of California’s water problems. The epic five-year drought is officially over, but not everywhere. Gov. Jerry Brown’s 2017 <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/article143321754.html\" target=\"_blank\">declaration ending the drought </a>omitted four counties where groundwater has been severely depleted: Fresno, Tulare, Kings and Tuolumne. The stricken canal serves two of those counties, Fresno and Tulare, along with Kern County.</p><p>It’s a problem that feeds on itself. If the canal can’t do its job, farmers downstream likely will pump more groundwater during dry years. A 2014 state law, the <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/article103987631.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Groundwater Management Act</a>, requires farmers to rein in their pumping, but the restrictions don’t fully kick in until 2040. Because farmers use some of the water from the canal to replenish groundwater, fixing the Friant-Kern would help coax the aquifers back to health.</p><p>During the drought, groundwater became a lifeline in this part of the Valley. Friant area farmers normally get water from the San Joaquin River, stored behind Friant Dam, but reservoir levels fell so low that the Central Valley Project didn’t deliver a drop of river water to Friant farmers in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>Desperate to keep their crops alive, farmers in Fresno County drilled 763 new wells in 2015 alone, according to the Department of Water Resources. In Tulare County, the number of new irrigation wells hit 1,069 that year. Overall, Valley farmers removed enough groundwater during the drought to <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/article151099812.html\" target=\"_blank\">fill Shasta Lake seven times</a> over, according to a study last year by researchers at UCLA and the University of Houston.<br/><br/></p><h3>A few inches a year</h3><p>Depletion of groundwater causes subterranean layers of clay and gravel to gradually compress. The earth’s surface drops, usually a few inches a year. </p><p>Over time, that translates into serious troubles, especially for gravity-fed systems. The Friant-Kern has no pumps; its concrete chute is supposed to ride a gentle slope that runs downhill 6 inches every mile, just steep enough to deliver water the full 152 miles from behind the Friant Dam near Fresno to a spot just north of Bakersfield.</p><p>The canal already had sunk several feet since the 1950s. The drought simply made the problem that much worse. At a point 100 miles south of the dam, just west of the tiny community of Terra Bella, the canal dropped about 2 feet between 2015 and 2017. That created a choke point that has left canal operators unable to deliver 60 percent of the water to farms and cities along the last 50 miles or so of the canal’s low spot.</p><p>The Valley’s well-drilling frenzy has abated as overall water conditions in the state have improved. Farmers drilled a total of 366 wells in Tulare and Fresno combined last year. Subsidence, however, persists. The ground continues to sink in some spots beneath the Friant-Kern, worsening the canal’s troubles. </p><p>“We’re still seeing some degradation,” DeFlitch said.<br/><br/></p><p> <!-- %asset:214628215% --> </p><p>NASA scientist Tom Farr, who has used satellite imagery to study subsidence, said a wet season can bring the land back to where it was — but recovery isn’t always 100 percent. Too much pumping can compact the layers of soil and gravel and permanently reduce underground water storage capacity.<br/><br/></p><p>In some cases, “you can’t restore it,” said Farr, who works at NASA’s Joint Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Over the past two decades, Farr said, some Valley aquifers have lost nearly 10 percent of their ability to store water. <br/><br/></p><p>Subsidence is hardly limited to the Friant region. In one infamous example, an area around Mendota, west of Fresno, sank 28 feet over a 50-year span beginning in 1925. NASA scientists last year reported<a href=\"https://www.water.ca.gov/LegacyFiles/waterconditions/docs/2017/JPL%20subsidence%20report%20final%20for%20public%20dec%202016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> finding “subsidence bowls” </a>in parts of the Valley, and depressions as far north as Woodland and areas north of Lake Tahoe. </p><p>Other segments of California’s water-delivery network have suffered from sinking ground.</p><p>A portion of the State Water Project’s California Aqueduct in Kings County lost 20 percent of its delivery capacity because of subsidence, the NASA researchers reported. The Department of Water Resources has spent $2 million on preliminary repairs, including the raising of the aqueduct’s sidewalls, but still is “in the early stages of developing alternatives to determine a long-term solution,” said spokeswoman Maggie Macias.<br/><br/></p><p>Subsidence often doesn’t look like much. The low point of the Friant-Kern Canal, near Terra Bella, doesn’t resemble a crevice or even a shallow bowl. It appears flat to the naked eye. The only visible sign of trouble is a bridge, part of Avenue 96, that crosses the canal near Terra Bella. It sits barely a foot above the water. It used to be 12 feet.</p><p> <!-- %asset:214809295% --> </p><p>The canal has been fixed once before to deal with subsidence, in 1979. The sides of the canal were raised so water cascading through the system wouldn’t lap over the sides at the point where the canal had lost elevation. It was a partial fix.</p><p>“It’s not a new problem,” DeFlitch said.</p><p>It became obvious in early 2017 that subsidence had become an urgent issue. Record rainfalls that winter had raised reservoir levels at Millerton Lake behind the dam, and canal operators prepared to release a generous slug of water into the canal. Because of the choke point, however, they realized they couldn’t ship as much water as they planned. Roughly 300,000 acre-feet of water had to be released directly into the San Joaquin River instead of going to farmers downstream of the low spot near Terra Bella. </p><h3>An opportunity lost</h3><p>The shortfall didn’t kill anyone’s crops that year; it represented just 14 percent of the total available supply along the Friant-Kern system. But it was a big opportunity lost for those at the southern end of the canal. DeFlitch said much of that water was going to be “banked” in Valley aquifers for use in the inevitable dry years — a crucial strategy in a region where water supply is notoriously unpredictable.</p><p>“We live and die by banking water,” said Friant Authority board member Edwin Camp, a Kern County farmer who grows almonds, oranges and other crops south of the canal’s choke point.</p><p>Friant officials still are wrestling with how to fix the canal. They might raise the sidewalls several feet, augmenting the work that was done in 1979. They also would have to elevate bridges that pass over the sunken canal.</p><p>Another strategy under consideration is installing a pumping plant at the choke point to move water through, although DeFlitch said the costs of operating the pumps would be substantial.</p><p>In any event, California taxpayers might foot the bill.</p><p>If voters approve Proposition 3 in November, the state would borrow $8.9 billion for various water projects, including $750 million to improve conservation and groundwater-recharge efforts in the Friant area. That sum would include an estimated $350 million to repair the Friant-Kern and a smaller canal, also operated by the Friant Authority, that suffers from subsidence.<br/><br/></p><p>Why shouldn’t Friant farmers pay for this? Didn’t they cause the problem by pumping groundwater? </p><p>Not exactly. Meral and independent experts say Friant’s farmers are only partly to blame. Much of the subsidence has been caused by farmers just outside Friant’s territory, they say.</p><p>If Proposition 3 fails in November, the funding question goes back to square one. Jason Phillips, the Friant Authority’s chief executive, said hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland would risk going out of production if their water supply remains constricted.<br/><br/></p><p>Farmers say repairs are needed — soon.</p><p>“We’re still dropping an inch a month in that pinch point,” Camp said. “When does that stop?”</p></div>",

LeBron James gave us the greatest four-year run South Florida has seen and felt in any sport.</p><p>We should be more than OK with the sweet memory of it – that it really happened, once – and hope the Heat is obsessed with its <em>next</em> glory days, not with the rear-view mirror.</p></div>",

There are plenty of ways to get bowl tickets without going through the university’s athletic department.</p><p>It does raise a red flag, however, and confirm that right after it was established that the Cats were headed to Tennessee to play a Big Ten team, Athletics Director Mitch Barnhart was right to make a plea to the fans for their support. Still, the AD is no doubt concerned about the response.</p><p>“Our fan base has always been tremendous in responding to that,” he said on that Sunday with regard to the 8,000 minimum. “I don’t see that being an issue.”</p><p>[<a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/john-clay/article187881449.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Frustrated Kentucky football fans, Mitch Barnhart hears and needs you</a>]</p><p>This isn’t a total surprise, however.

Throw in the 45-7 loss at Mississippi State and arguably the three best teams on UK’s schedule handled the Cats by a combined count of 131-37.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/kentucky-sports/uk-football/article191690319.html#navlink=Lead\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Tuesday’s football news </a>that outside linebacker/defensive end Denzil Ware has been suspended for the bowl game doesn’t help.

Then you see how down to earth he is.”</p><p>Calipari even got an unexpected reaction from the normally reserved Kinnard, an offensive lineman from Cleveland, who signed with UK on Wednesday with 19 other players.</p><p>“He was looking at Coach Cal and Kevin Knox, meeting them guys and saying, ‘Wow,’” Marrow recalled. “Cal does a good job with us. I can’t thank them guys enough.”<strong> </strong></p><p>Basketball was mentioned a little earlier Wednesday, too, when both head coach Mark Stoops and Marrow said they like to recruit players who spent some time on the hardwood as well as on the football field.</p><p>“We have some pretty good basketball players on our team, and I think a lot of these guys either ran track or played basketball or did some other good stuff,” Stoops mentioned specifically of wide receiver Bryce Oliver, a late get out of Sunrise, Fla.</p><p>When Stoops and Marrow are on recruiting visits together, the recruiting coordinator said they often try to catch a player’s basketball game while there.</p><p>“You see guys’ hand-eye coordination, change of direction,” Marrow, a star basketball and football player at Cardinal Mooney High School, said of the other sport aiding in the assessment process.</p><p>“I wish a lot of guys played basketball. That’s when you get a true evaluation of how athletic they are.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p>Jennifer Smith: <a href=\"tel:859-231-3241\" title=\"\">859-231-3241</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenheraldleader\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">@jenheraldleader</a></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div></div>",

"summary": "Kentucky basketball is 9-2 heading into Friday’s game against Louisville. So far, John Calipari’s extremely young club has been hard to figure out.",
"content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>We are 11 games into the Kentucky men’s basketball season. The Cats play archrival Louisville on Friday. SEC play starts Sunday. Yet I’m not sure we have any better read on John Calipari’s club than we did the day before the season opener.</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>The Cats are 9-2. Last Saturday’s <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sidelines-with-john-clay/article191458899.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">CBS Sports Classic loss to UCLA </a>dropped them from seventh to 16th in the <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/kentucky-sports/uk-basketball-men/article191562599.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">AP poll</a>. CBS Sports’ <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-rankings-big-east-conference-play-begins-wednesday/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Garry Parrish’s daily rankings </a>has them 17th. The current <a href=\"https://kenpom.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Ken Pomeroy numbers </a>place them 18th. The <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/rpi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">RPI</a> has them at No. 26. They are 38th in ESPN’s <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/bpi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Basketball Power Index</a>. </p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>A soft schedule has skewed some numbers. <a href=\"http://sagarin.com/sports/cbsend.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Jeff Sagarin’s computer</a>, which has the Cats ranked 22nd overall, rates the schedule at No. 116 in degree of difficulty out of the 351 Division I teams. ESPN’s BPI concurs. Pomeroy puts it at No. 109. The RPI has UK’s strength of schedule at No. 46.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Through 11 games, Kentucky has played just one AP ranked team. That was Kansas in the Champions Classic in Chicago on Nov. 14. At the time, the Jayhawks were ranked No. 4. <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sidelines-with-john-clay/article184693428.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">UK lost 65-61</a>. UCLA was No. 21 in the preseason, but the Bruins had not been ranked for four consecutive polls when they beat the Cats at the Smoothie King Center.</p><p><!-- %asset:191448079% --></p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Virginia Tech is Kentucky’s best win to date. <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sidelines-with-john-clay/article190189434.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">UK beat the Hokies 93-86</a> on Dec. 16 in Rupp Arena. The opponent from the ACC was 9-1 overall at the time. Yet a soft schedule of their own had kept Buzz Williams’ team out of the rankings, as well.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Kentucky is young. Perhaps you’ve heard. Very young, in fact. Of all Calipari’s young Kentucky teams, this is his youngest. It’s the least experienced team in the country, according to Pomeroy’s metrics. In fact, it’s the least experienced team in the 11 years since Pomeroy started calculating such things.</p><p>Here’s what we don’t know:</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>How much this team can improve. Because of the aforementioned youth, the thought pattern all along was that if the Cats struggled early, they would be much better by March. The hope was they would be so much better, they would be tough to deal with at tournament time. Even that, however, seems contingent on some other factors.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Are the Cats strong enough at point guard? Calipari’s better teams have excelled at the point. John Wall. Brandon Knight. Marquis Teague. Andrew Harrison. Tyler Ulis. De’Aaron Fox. This year, Quade Green and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander have shared the spot. Both are talented. Yet neither has quite mastered the art of directing the offense. </p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Is Kevin Knox more than just a shooter? <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/21590899/2018-nba-mock-draft-picks-chicago-bulls-cleveland-cavaliers-philadelphia-76ers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The NBA Draft experts </a>consider the freshman forward UK’s best pro prospect. He does lead the team in scoring, but he settles for jumpers more than Calipari would like. And at 6-9, Knox has just 10 offensive rebounds in 11 games. He also leads the team in turnovers. There’s work to be done.</p><p><!-- %asset:191449829% --></p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Can Hamidou Diallo shoot? That was the question entering the season and I’m still not sure we have a clear-cut answer. Against Virginia Tech, when the redshirt freshman drained four of seven three-point attempts, the answer was yes. Against UCLA, when Diallo was 1-of-5, the answer was no. </p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Can PJ Washington be a consistent presence? An engaged Washington shows why Rivals ranked him the 15th-best prospect in the Class of 2018. At times, however, the 6-7 forward all but disappears. Five times he’s scored in double figures; six times he has not. Only once has he scored in double figures in back-to-back games.</p><p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Will Jarred Vanderbilt play this year? The 6-7 freshman could definitely provide a boost. Yet no one is saying <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/kentucky-sports/uk-basketball-men/article187370813.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">exactly where Vanderbilt stands </a>with regard to the foot he injured in preseason. Optimists claim video stills revealed him practicing in New Orleans. Others whisper he’s likely to sit out the season. So far, his status is as mysterious as his team.</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p>John Clay: <a href=\"tel:859-231-3266\" title=\"\">859-231-3226</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnclayiv\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">@johnclayiv</a></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><div class=\"ng_factbox\"><div class=\"ng_factbox_head\"><p>Pomeroy rankings of UK’s opponents so far</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><ul><li>6 - Kansas</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>37 - Virginia Tech</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>52 - UCLA</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>75 - Vermont</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>94 - East Tennessee State</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>142 - Monmouth</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>149 - Utah Valley</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>157 - Fort Wayne</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>170 - Harvard</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>172 - Troy</li><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><li>214 - UIC</li></ul><p>Note: <a href=\"https://kenpom.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">kenpom.com </a>ranks Louisville 32nd. </p></div></div>",

"summary": "Henry Bridges, who founded Charlotte's Community School of the Arts, has died at 90. The school was started to offer music lessons to poor children but now also offers instruction in the visual arts, serving 4,500 students a year.",
"content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>In 1969, the year a federal judge ruled that Charlotte's schools were illegally segregated, the white organist and choir director of First Presbyterian Church had 15 pianos in the basement that sat unused most of the time.</p><p>Henry Bridges also noticed that the poor, mostly African American kids who lived around the uptown church needed something to do. He invited them in and started to teach them piano.</p><p>So began the <a href=\"https://www.csarts.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Community School of the Arts</a>. Bridges recruited four of the best piano teachers in Charlotte — one of them, Dzidra Reimanis, 90, still teaches there — and winnowed an initial 20 students from more than 150 applicants. The children were taught five days a week in piano, choir and music theory. All of it was free.</p><p>Henry Percival Bridges died Tuesday, at 90, at his home. He had retired from teaching in 1992 but remained a director of the school. He and his late wife Daisy were also active in several other Charlotte arts organizations.</p><p>\"He attracted the top talent, the best of the best,\" to teach at the school, said Devlin McNeil, the school's current president and executive director.</p><p><!-- %asset:206214374; alt=\"Henry Bridges.JPG\"% --></p><p>Over the years, the school expanded to tuition-based programs for families who could afford lessons. It continued free and discounted programs for those who couldn't. The school now has a faculty of over 70 who serve more than 4,500 students a year.</p><p>With his flowing gray hair, old car and well-worn clothes, Bridges gave no clue that he came from a wealthy family, said the Rev. William Wood, the former First Presbyterian Church minister who grew up with him in Johnson City, Tennessee.</p><p>\"He was so gentle and kind,\" Wood said, recalling that a church secretary once mistook Bridges for a homeless person. \"He heard different music in his head.\"</p><p>His father had wanted him to become a Presbyterian minister, Wood said. Bridges instead attended Davidson College and earned a master's degree in sacred music from Union Theological Seminary after deciding music was his calling. With his work at the Community School of the Arts, Wood said, Bridges found another ministry to children.</p><p>\"He always had a heart for the underprivileged,\" Wood said. \"He got that from his mother. As a boy, (poor) people would come to the door of their fine house and she would give them sandwiches. He had a real passion for helping children and helping people.\"</p><p>Bridges stepped down as executive director of the Community School of the Arts in 1982, but hauled his own piano to the Piedmont Courts public housing project and became a full-time — but still free — teacher there for another 10 years</p><p>The school moved in 1998 from First Presbyterian Church to Spirit Square. Over time, it added classes in dance and theater but now concentrates on private and group music lessons, visual arts, summer camps and early-childhood education and extensive community outreach. It still teaches widely in low-income neighborhoods and offers financial aid to students, \"honoring its founding mission and the belief that outstanding arts education should be available to all,\" according to the school's website.</p><p>Kathy Ridge, who served as the school's executive director from 2003 to 2007, said Bridges was at first skeptical that a former banker with no musical or arts administration experience would be a good fit. But she also recalls being transfixed by their first conversation, in which he talked about his aspirations for the school.</p><p>Despite his casual attire — she said he nattily dressed for special occasions and owned a yellow Thunderbird convertible — Ridge said, Bridges had \"gorgeous, twinkling eyes\" and a charm that could make listeners feel like they were the only people in a crowded room.</p><p>\"He captivated me right then with his mission and purpose,\" Ridge said. \"He was convinced that it changed the life trajectories for kids who couldn’t otherwise take music lessons.\"</p><p>In retirement, according to an Observer article, Bridges rose early each day, bought and sold stocks, and spent hours practicing his organ or piano.</p><p> \"Religion, the arts and education are all central to life,\" he told an interviewer in 1989. \"They are really three facets of the same thing. You don't go to a museum without having some kind of transcendental experience. The same can be said of dance, music and theater — they're all interrelated. Central to the core of the universe are a belief in God, creativity and consciousness. That's what the arts are all about. \"</p></div>",

Put something in his mouth. Put something over his head.”</p>\n<p>The plot, to kill a prosecutor’s father, was foiled in April 2014. The inmate – a founder of the United Blood Nation – was sentenced in November to life plus 84 months on kidnapping and related charges.</p>\n<p>Top state officials acknowledge there’s only one way an inmate in solitary confinement at maximum-security Polk Correctional Institution got a cellphone: An employee helped.</p>\n<p>Prison staffers smuggle in cellphones and make thousands of dollars selling them to inmates they’re supposed to guard, a Charlotte Observer investigation found. Despite the abundance of phones, crooked officers are rarely caught and charged, records show.</p>\n<p>Cellphones not only compromise the security of the prisons but also – as the kidnapping case illustrates – endanger public safety.</p>\n<p>“The very idea of prison is to cut people off from society – cellphones undo that,” said Martin Horn, a former secretary of corrections in Pennsylvania who lectures at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. “Cellphones make prison walls obsolete.”</p>\n<div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-horizontal\"><p><!-- %asset:153557184; alt=\"Timothy Ray Jones\"% --></p>\n</div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span><h3>‘In prison, money talks’<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></h3><p>Former officers and inmates told the Observer that hundreds of contraband phones can be found in some of North Carolina’s 55 prisons on any given day.</p>\n<p>A single sweep once netted more than 100 at Lanesboro Correctional Institution, according to Rufus Carter, a former sergeant at the Anson County prison. “If they found over 100 cellphones at Lanesboro,” Carter said, “I can promise you there were three times that number that weren’t found.”</p>\n<p>In the state’s most dangerous prisons, employees sneak in most of the contraband, prison leaders acknowledge.</p>\n<p>Employees sometimes hide phones and drugs inside their lunch containers – tucked in bags of chips, sandwiches or soda cans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<!-- %highline_quote:1; hidden=\"1\"% --><p>Unlike some states, North Carolina doesn’t routinely frisk employees when they enter prisons. The state also allows them to carry in clear plastic lunch boxes – an accommodation, officials said, for working 12-hour shifts but also a means of hiding phones.</p>\n<p>When former inmate Timothy Ray Jones was at Scotland Correctional, he said, he paid a female correctional officer $150 to smuggle in an inexpensive flip phone, which he then used to run a drug ring.</p>\n<p>Growing up in Robeson County, Jones said he got hooked on drugs and alcohol and broke the law to feed his addictions. He was first locked up in 1996, at age 17, for robbery and assault. He is now 37, and was released last summer after serving a sentence for felony larceny.</p>\n<p>Jones said he enlisted the help of two female officers to run the drug ring. The three of them shared a secret code:</p>\n<p>If the second officer rubbed her stomach when she entered his cell block, that meant drug-sniffing dogs were checking staff on their way into work. If she rubbed her head, the dogs weren’t there.</p>\n<p>Jones said he used the phone to alert the first officer, who would be waiting outside with marijuana and sometimes cocaine. He let her know whether it was safe to smuggle in the drugs, concealed in fake 7-Up cans that unscrewed to reveal a hidden compartment.</p>\n<p>For every pound of pot the officers smuggled in, Jones said, he rewarded them with $700 each – twice a month for two years. If his figures are accurate – and other inmates gave similar accounts of their own deals – that means the women made an extra $17,000 a year.</p>\n<p>“In prison,” Jones said, “money talks.”</p>\n<h3>Vulnerable to extortion<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></h3><p>Several inmates shared stories of running drugs with the help of officers. All said cellphones were key to the operations. All spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear reprisal and criminal charges.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>A former Lanesboro inmate, who worked as a janitor at the prison, said for three years he delivered weekly contraband packages from officers to prisoners in solitary confinement. The vacuum-sealed bags usually held a pound of marijuana and a gram of crack, he said – also five cellphones because demand was so high.</p>\n<p>Cellphones, the inmate said, were crucial to the smuggling. He used them to make sure it was safe to move the drugs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>Another inmate serving time for first-degree murder said that, while he was at Odom Correctional Institution near Roanoke Rapids, he paid a female officer $2,500 for a typical shipment: 10 phones and a pound of marijuana. The officer smuggled in the contraband every two weeks for two years, the inmate said.</p>\n<p>The prisoner, who is a gang member, said some inmates use phones to exact “rent” from families of other prisoners. “If they don’t pay, they will cut or stab the person,” he said.</p>\n<p>Myra Nance-Pastore of Fayetteville told the Observer she got a call in 2015 from a gang member using a contraband phone at Maury Correctional Institution in eastern North Carolina. She said the caller demanded $700 in monthly “rent” so her son, who is in a wheelchair in prison, wouldn’t be hurt or killed.</p>\n<p>Nance-Pastore refused to pay and reported the incident to officials. She said the gang member was transferred to another prison.</p>\n<p>“I was worried because they could send people on the outside to where I lived,” she said. “It scared me to death. I really thought about moving, it scared me that bad.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"ng_z_sym_square_bullet\">▪ </span>A former habitual felon at Pasquotank Correctional Institution in Elizabeth City said he and another prisoner paid a warehouse supervisor $8,000 to help smuggle in four hollowed-out printers, each hiding about 15 cellphones and five pounds of tobacco.</p>\n<p>“To get the big stuff into the prison, you have to go through staff,” the former inmate said.</p>\n<p>Staff members, in turn, become vulnerable to extortion.</p>\n<p>“They do it once, that inmate owns them,” said Gary Harkins, former research and information director for the American Correctional Officer Intelligence Network. “... You bring in marijuana, next time he wants you to bring in a cellphone. The next time, ammunition, a knife, harder stuff.”</p>\n<p>Since 2012, police have charged more than 50 N.C. employees with smuggling contraband into prisons.</p>\n<h3>‘A slippery slope’<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></h3><p>At Polk Correctional, north of Durham, where the kidnapping plot unfolded three years ago, Blood gang leader Kelvin Melton was locked up on the HCON unit – short for “High Security Maximum Control.” Prisoners are placed there when they pose a threat to other inmates, staff or the security of the prison itself.</p>\n<p>Federal documents suggest that control over the unit began unraveling when correctional officer Gregory Dustin Gouldman was transferred there in August 2012 as sergeant on the night shift.</p>\n<div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-square\"><p><!-- %asset:153557179; alt=\"Melton\"% --></p>\n</div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span><p>Gouldman was one of three officers who supplied Melton with phones, according to an inmate’s court testimony. One of the other officers was a member of the Bloods, he said.</p>\n<p>Gouldman was indicted on charges of bringing cellphones, tobacco and drugs to inmates, and pleaded guilty to extortion. In January, he was sentenced to five years in prison. Contacted on Facebook before his sentencing, Gouldman refused to comment.</p>\n<p>The indictment describes how he became involved with inmates.</p>\n<p>Gouldman and other officers sneaked in cigarettes and alcohol at night for their own use, according to the indictment.</p>\n<p>To appease unruly prisoners, who threw feces and urine at them – a tactic known as “gassing the guards” – the officers relaxed some rules inside HCON, according to the indictment. They agreed to pass notes – called “kites” – between inmates. They allowed inmates to cover up cell windows, preventing anyone from seeing in. They let prisoners smoke marijuana.</p>\n<p>By early 2014, court records say, Gouldman had begun working as a “mule” and smuggling in contraband for three inmates. He earned $32,000 a year as an officer; prisoners paid him thousands of dollars more, the indictment states, for sneaking in drugs, tobacco and cellphones.</p>\n<p>The first contraband Gouldman smuggled in for an inmate was a pack of cigarettes that he sold for $50, according to court records. Then came larger items, including a $7 cellphone for $300 and a package containing a cellphone, cigar, cash and two packs of cigarettes for $425.</p>\n<p>Once, according to the indictment, Gouldman brought in two cellphones wrapped in electrical tape and tucked inside a Subway sandwich. Another time, he carried two phones inside a large bag of Lay’s potato chips.</p>\n<p>“Every block had some (phones),” Jamey Wilkins, a former inmate on Polk’s HCON unit, testified during Melton’s trial. “I mean, a lot.”</p>\n<h3>Access to cellphones<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></h3><p>As control over the HCON unit weakened, the kidnapping plot unfolded in early 2014.</p>\n<p>Melton, 52, who went by the nicknames “Dizzy” and “Old Man,” had previously been convicted in New York of first-degree robbery and manslaughter. In 2012, the gang leader was sentenced to life for ordering the shooting of an ex-lover’s boyfriend in Raleigh.</p>\n<p>He was locked in a cell with a narrow plexiglass window, a steel toilet and a concrete bed fitted with a mattress. Like other inmates on the unit, he was allowed out five times a week for an hour of “recreation” in an indoor area. He had to eat in his cell and was allowed no physical contact with other inmates or visitors.</p>\n<p>But two times – on July 6, 2013 and Feb. 24, 2014 – Melton was cited for having a cellphone.</p>\n<p>Gerald Beaver, a Fayetteville lawyer who represented Melton, said in an interview that there was “a lot of evidence that phones were all over the HCON block.” He described them as communal phones, smuggled in by officers and shared by inmates. Prisoners said in court that the officers passed phones from one prisoner to the next, hidden in magazines, clothes or food carts.</p>\n<h3>The kidnapping<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></h3><p>After the N.C. Court of Appeals upheld Melton’s sentence of life in prison in March 2014, he used a contraband cellphone to call Blood gang members on the streets. He ordered them to go after the assistant district attorney who prosecuted his case. He told them how to kill the woman, get rid of the body and clean the crime scene.</p>\n<p>But on April 5, the gang members mistakenly went to the prosecutor’s father’s house in an upscale neighborhood east of Raleigh. They stunned him with a Taser, pistol-whipped him and kidnapped him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span><p>Melton was on the phone with one of the gang members as they loaded Frank Janssen into the car, pistol-whipping him again.</p>\n<p>At Melton’s orders, they drove to an Atlanta apartment, where they handcuffed Janssen and kept him taped to a chair inside a locked closet for four days.</p>\n<p>According to court records, Melton was in constant contact with the kidnappers and dictated text messages to be sent to Janssen’s wife. One message said that if she contacts police, “we will send him back to you in 6 boxes. We will do a drive by and gun down anybody in you (sic) family and we will throw gernades (sic) in you (sic) window.”</p>\n<p>In one telephone conversation, Melton instructed the kidnappers on how to kill Janssen and hide his body. He told them to either put a bag over his head or use a gun to “kill him and get it over with,” according to a female accomplice. She said that Melton also told them to kill the owner of the Atlanta apartment and his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>The gang members had already bought bleach to clean the closet and shovels to dig the grave, records show. They picked out a spot near railroad tracks to bury Janssen.</p>\n<p>On April 9, 2014, investigators rescued Janssen after tracking text messages and calls from the kidnappers. The kidnappers were found guilty and received sentences ranging from 20 to more than 50 years.</p>\n<p>Melton was transferred to the ADX Super Max Federal Penitentiary in Colorado, which is designed to cut inmates off from the world. Other inmates include a Boston marathon bomber, a man who helped plot the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and four men behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center.</p>\n<p>At Melton’s trial last November, Larry Dunston, the state’s former assistant superintendent of security services, testified that corrupt officers must have supplied Melton with cellphones.</p>\n<p>“I confronted him about his cellphone,” Dunston testified. “He was explaining to me that there was more of my people on his side than his people on my side, meaning our correctional staff were involved with him.”</p>\n<h3>New law<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></h3><p>David Guice, N.C. chief deputy secretary of adult corrections and juvenile justice, said only a small percentage of officers is corrupt. But he acknowledged that cellphones and other contraband are “a big problem.”</p>\n<p>“It bothers every person in this room when we find or hear of a staff member who has been compromised,” Guice said during an Observer interview with North Carolina prison leaders.</p>\n<p>Wendell Hargrave, who oversees prison security, said there’s no foolproof system for stopping contraband.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to happen,” he said. “But we take every measure we can to make sure it’s at a minimum.”</p>\n<p>Because of the kidnapping, the N.C. General Assembly made it a felony to give an inmate a phone and a felony for an inmate to have one. Just two officers have been charged under that law from 2015-16, data show.</p>\n<p>“This is the prison system basically protecting its own,” said Alex Friedmann, managing editor of Prison Legal News. “If they really believed their own rhetoric...then they would crack down harder on staff.”</p>\n<p>The tougher criminal sanction doesn’t appear to have stopped the flow of phones into North Carolina’s prisons. In 2015, officers confiscated 556 contraband cellphones. In 2016, they found 535.</p>\n<p>Inmates and officers say there are many, many more.</p>\n<div class=\"ng_endnote_contrib\"><p>Staff writer Ames Alexander contributed.</p>\n<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></div><div class=\"ng_factbox\"><div class=\"ng_factbox_head\"><p>Prison officers are almost never drug tested</p>\n<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"></span></div><p>In North Carolina’s prisons, it’s not uncommon to see people who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, inmates and officers say.</p>\n<p>And some of those people, they say, are staff members.

          "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Caribbean countries laud themselves on offering idyllic settings where sandy beaches, calming calypso and a laid-back lifestyle beckon. </p><p>But behind the happy-go-lucky image, the region also harbors a darker side: violent crime and a tolerance for domestic violence.</p><p>According to a new study, “Restoring Paradise in the Caribbean: Combatting Violence with Numbers,” the region has some of the lowest victimization by property crime in the world but one of the world’s highest violent crime rates. Nearly 1 in 3 citizens has lost someone to violence, and individuals are more likely to be a victim of assault or a threat than anywhere else in the hemisphere.</p><p>“Tourists, who are not targets of this violent crime in the Caribbean, may be completely unaware that Caribbean citizens are becoming increasingly concerned, and for valid reasons, about violence,” said Heather Sutton, the lead researcher behind the Inter-American Development Bank study based on victimization surveys and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQGN8mDpOG0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">released Tuesday </a>during an Inter-American Dialogue panel discussion in Washington, D.C. “Caribbean governments are making significant efforts and spending robust amounts of their budgets trying to solve this problem.”</p><p>The study focuses on five Caribbean countries — the Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname. Some 3,000 individuals living in each country’s capital were surveyed. Rather than rely solely on police homicide reports, researchers questioned the victims of crime, 47 percent of whom don’t report incidents to law enforcement. </p><p>Rising crime rates, especially soaring homicide rates in a country like Jamaica, have long been a leading concern in the region and remain a persistent challenge. Another Inter-American Development Bank study, for example, found that one in four Bahamian businesses had been victimized by crime in 2013-14 and crime was a major concern for Bahamians, who last week <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article150060742.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">kicked out the ruling government </a>of the past five years in a general election and ushered in the opposition.</p><p>This week, the chamber of commerce president in Clarendon, Jamaica, complained that an increase in reports of murders, robberies, extortion, and other unlawful activities in the parish were scaring off investors. The parish was cited earlier this month by Jamaica’s National Security Minister Robert Montague as one of the places where fear of victimization remained high despite a 2016 Jamaican crime survey showing victimization levels declining nationally.</p><div class=\"ng_digital\"><div class=\"photo-inline-horizontal\"><p><!-- %asset:150718767; alt=\"JAMAICA_REVIVAL_6_991855\"% --></p></div></div><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span><p>Dr. David Allen, a psychiatrist who studies crime in the Bahamas and examines the stories behind the incidents, said the findings of the Caribbean Crime Victimization Survey correspond to what he’s uncovered during his decade of research. Allen has blamed the island-nation’s increase in violence on the Bahamas’s crack cocaine crisis of the 1980s and the country’s economic downturn. It has led, he said, to a breakdown of family values and the formation of youth gangs. </p><p>“Crime is a public health problem,” he said. “Public health means it cannot be solved just by law enforcement.”</p><p>Allen says what is needed, not only in the Bahamas but throughout the Caribbean, is an anti-crime or citizens’ protection council, where victims and even perpetrators of crime join with clergy, businesses owners, government ministers, police and other law enforcement personnel to study the problem and come up with solutions. One place where they can start is with the victims, he said, who are often forgotten. The victims, in turn, victimize others because of their anger resulting from their trauma. </p><p>“There is a high traumatization<strong> </strong>rate,” Allen said. “If a person is traumatized, particularly a child, they will go into more violence.”</p><p>Sutton said researchers not only found that revenge attacks were a common motivation behind homicides in the Bahamas, but children who are either victims of violence or witnessed violence in their homes risk becoming perpetrators of violence.</p><p>“This is a red flag and this is one of the drivers of the high levels of crime we are seeing — exposure to violence,” she said.</p><div class=\"ng_mm_link1\"><div><style>@import 'http://media.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/2017/embed-helper/styles/main.css'</style><div class=\"MHembed MHembed__graphic MHgraphic__full MHgraphic__4col\"><a href=\"http://media.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/2017/graphics/05-16-Caribbean.svg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"MHembed__graphic--img\" src=\"http://media.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/2017/graphics/05-16-Caribbean.svg\"/> </a></div> \n</div></div><p>The Caribbean, she noted, has a high level of tolerance for violence in the home, violence against women and physical discipline. For example, a majority, 66 percent, of Caribbean respondents supported physically disciplining a child who misbehaved, while one in three Caribbean adults — more so than those in Latin America or the United States — had no issues with wife-beating if a woman is unfaithful. </p><p>But while rising crime threatens to taint the Caribbean’s image , Sutton noted that the crime is not everywhere and is often far from the luxurious, tourists resorts that the region has become dependent on. Still, crime is costly, with the survey estimating that it costs the Caribbean 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product, with Barbados being the country least affected and the Bahamas most affected.</p><p>Meanwhile, the region’s crime victims are often concentrated in poorer communities where graffiti, trash and abandoned buildings are the norm, trust among neighbors is low and gangs are aplenty.</p><p>“Overall, most violent crimes were committed in victims’ neighborhoods or homes,” the study found. “Residents are more likely to be attacked or threatened by someone they know than to be robbed by a stranger.”</p><p>The survey found that in Port of Spain, Trinidad, for example, crime is also highly concentrated in certain street segments within neighborhoods.</p><p>“Three percent of street<strong> </strong>segments concentrated 50 percent of all crimes,” the study found. </p><p>Though their prevalence and power vary from country to country, gangs are responsible for most of the crime and violence in the Caribbean, according to the study.</p><p>Some 28 percent of the Caribbean Crime Victimization Survey respondents reported a gang presence in their neighborhood. Gang presence was highest in the capital areas of the countries with the highest rates of homicide, assault and threat: Port of Spain (49 percent), New Providence (39 percent), and Kingston (32 percent). Among respondents with gangs in their neighborhood, more than half said that gangs interfere with everyday activities.</p><p><strong>“</strong>We’ve got kids having to go through different turfs owned by different gangs to go to school,” said Allen, the psychiatrist. </p><p>“Life has become cheap,” Allen added. “Before we had to bring in killers to do the dirty work. Now we have local killers. Before they killed in the dark, now they kill in the daylight and they kill anywhere.”</p><p>And they are doing it with guns in the Bahamas, where the survey found that firearms are involved in 82 percent of the homicides, compared to 73 percent in Jamaica and 73 percent in Trinidad and Tobago. </p><p>“Greater use of firearms in assaults and robberies leadsto a higher rate of homicides levels,” said Sutton, noting that Barbados and Suriname had relatively low homicide rates compared to the other countries and half of the violent crimes were committed with knives.</p><p>Sutton said the hope is that the study will help Caribbean governments, which now spend more on policing than justice, to better use their limited resources to fight violent crime. Among some of the initiatives already taking place is “hot spot” policing in Trinidad and Tobago. Using data, police have figured out what hours of the day and what streets a crime is likely to take place and as a result, increase patrols in those areas.</p><p>“They found in fact a 44 percent reduction in crime in those neighborhoods where they are doing increased patrolling,” Sutton said.</p><p>But she cautioned that policing is not the only solution to this problem.</p><p>“You really need need to have stronger prevention initiatives,” she said.</p></div>",

You don’t take a player 22nd if you don’t expect him to do so.</p><p>He’ll be in the rotation at defensive end.</p><p>And his job?</p><p>“I get to that quarterback,” Harris said “I’m going to cause pressure, without a doubt. At the end of the day, it’s about what you’ve got in your heart.”</p><p>The Dolphins saw that heart on tape and in their meeting with him in Indianapolis.</p><p>Harris led the Tigers in sacks (9) and tackles for loss (12) as a junior in 2016. His first step is lightning. Chris Buford, a Dolphins area scout whose coverage area includes Missouri, connected with him on a personal level during the fall.</p><p>But Buford didn’t need to sell Harris to the rest of the team. His colleagues were all-in on their own, particularly after he aced his interview at the Combine. But they wanted to keep that love quiet. They didn’t fly Harris to Miami for a visit in an attempt to keep their interest on the sly. The first time he’ll visit South Florida is Friday.</p><p><!-- %asset:147311849% --></p><p>Circumstances helped make this dream a reality.</p><p>This was pegged as the most unpredictable draft in years, and it lived up to the billing — to Miami’s benefit.</p><p>The Bears began the madness by sending a slew of picks to San Francisco to move up from No.<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"133\"> </span>3 to 2, using that pick on North Carolina quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.</p><p>That started an unexpected run on offensive players — Western Michigan receiver Corey Davis at No.<span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"133\"> </span>5, Washington receiver John Ross at 9, Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes at 10 and Clemson’s Deshaun Watson at 12 — that pushed talented defensive players down.</p><p>Then it turned.</p><p>The Cardinals selected Temple linebacker Haason Reddick at 13.</p><p>The Eagles selected Tennessee defensive end Derek Barnett at 14.</p><p>The Redskins selected Alabama defensive end Jonathan Allen at 17.</p><p>And the Lions selected Florida linebacker Jarrad Davis at 21.</p><p>But with that Davis pick, the war room got giddy.</p><p>The Dolphins knew they would get a player they had targeted a month ago.</p><p><!-- %asset:147295804% --></p><p>And so even though trade inquiries came while Miami was on the clock, they didn’t bite.</p><p>“We didn’t really talk much about what they offered,” Grier said of the two teams that called.</p><p>Instead they stuck to their board, turned in their card and then celebrated.</p><p>“This is a player that everybody in the building wanted,” Grier added.</p><p>Harris, meanwhile, was a bit stunned. He didn’t envision Miami as his new home.</p><p>And yet the call from South Florida “made me feel amazing.”</p><p>Harris added: “I’m a baller. I know I am. I’m going to work hard. I’m a baller.

          "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>A confession: I may be somewhat — no, make that blatantly — predisposed to approve wholeheartedly of the Dolphins’ first-round selection of Missouri pass rusher Charles Harris in the NFL Draft on Thursday night. I happened to predict Harris-to-Miami in my annual Mock Draft (luck my Daddy would have referred to as a blind squirrel finding an acorn), so I love the pick first because it makes me look good, I’d admit. My nitpicking and yeah-butting what Miami did would be a little like a man who just hit the lottery complaining about the winning numbers.</p><p> <!-- %asset:147311849% --></p><p>But I love the pick for other reasons, too. By dumb luck it might make me look good, but by calculated reasoning and logic it makes the Dolphins look good. Makes this look like a team that has an understanding of its fundamental imbalance and has set out to correct that.</p><p>Miami has begun to show the signs of the maturity and self-awareness that capably run franchises tend to. This was a team, with reason, that spent a lot of years and capital trying to grow an offense — mainly trying to surround quarterback Ryan Tannehill with enough talent to erase all of the excuses why he might not be good enough and replace them with all of the reasons he could be.</p><p>Now, finally, it is time to turn attention to the neglected other side of the line of scrimmage, and the Dolphins are doing so. Unmistakably. Pretty impressively, too.</p><p>It is worth noting that Dolphins, a franchise most associated with Dan Marino’s bombardier attack, have a deeper heritage of stopping the other guys. The No-Name Defense. The Killer B’s. More recently, the prideful epoch fronted by Hall of Famer Jason Taylor and by Zach Thomas. The Dolphins used to make a point of making busy days for the other teams’ punters.</p><p>Miami won’t be more than what it is presently — a pretty good team that barely makes the playoffs then bows out quickly — unless its improving and potentially formidable offense is balanced by a new-era defense good enough to, I dunno, maybe even inspire a nickname or something.</p><p>The Dolphins recently made a clear emphasis of defense in free agency, led by the signing of longtime Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons, and the draft opened with Miami continuing that emphasis. It should continue Friday and Saturday as the seven rounds play out. Other than stockpiling talent on the interior offensive line (guard, center), defense should remain the imperative. A cornerback should arrive Friday.</p><p>I mean, seriously, if Tannehill can’t fly with the surrounding cast he’s been given, then that’s on him, on his own right wing. He has a young Pro Bowl running back in Jay Ajayi. They targeted improvement at tight end. He has Jarvis Landry, Devante Parker and Kenny Stills to play catch. Three-fifths of his blockers are first-round draft picks.</p><p>The offense seems set, solid.</p><p>Defense, please.</p><p>Charles Harris, the new No. 1, is not a perfect candidate or certain star because players selected 22nd overall seldom are. If 21 times other teams could have had you but said nah, that’s either a stupendous draft or you have a flaw or two. Harris may be slightly undersized. He isn’t great against the run. What he <em>is</em> great at is deploying that spin move of his to get to the other team’s quarterback, which in the modern NFL, increasingly, is paramount.</p><p>Cam Wake is 35. Miami needs its next great sackman. Harris is a promising candidate. And that’s good enough for now. Notice how Miami used very little of its allotted clock time to make its pick? Harris was their guy. That was clear.</p><p>The Dolphins could have given Tannehill another gift Thursday by drafting UM tight end David Njoku, but that would have been the luxury pick this club cannot afford. The Fins could have taken Western Kentucky guard Forrest Lamp at a need position but a first-round guard almost always is a reach. (Miami last drafted a pure guard in the first round with Roy Foster in 1982).</p><p>No, this draft needed to be about defense first, and promisingly it has begun that way. Harris can play defensive end. He can play outside linebacker. Mostly, he can find the pocket and pick it clean, make QBs quiver.</p><p>“I’m going to ball,” Harris told local reporters by way of introduction Thursday night. “I’m going to come into the league and I’m going to dominate”</p><p>Hey, if it starts with attitude, that’s a good start, right? “</p><p>Dolfans should like Harris as the pick, as a player, but mostly they should like that their team seems serious about getting back in balance with a credible defense.</p><p>Think of it like this, if you wish:</p><p>An appreciably better defense would rank way up there among all of the gifts this club has provided to make Ryan Tannehill’s life easier.</p></div>",

          "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>The Dolphins identified Charles Harris as their guy a month ago — in March. </p><p>That, by the way, is really, really early in the draft process, particularly when a team is picking in the last third of the NFL Draft’s first round.</p><p>And yet, Harris was the Dolphins’ guy. They met him once at the NFL Scouting Combine in March and that, plus the tape of him chasing quarterbacks and running backs and making 12 tackles for loss and collecting nine sacks as a junior, sold them on their first-round selection Thursday.</p><p>No predraft visit.</p><p>No other contact to speak of.</p><p>The Dolphins were sold on Harris and one other player they targeted at No. 22 overall, according to general manager Chris Grier. Grier declined to say who the other player was, but I reported days ago it was Derek Barnett. Barnett went Philadelphia pn Thursday night before the Dolphins had a chance to make a choice on him or Harris.</p><p>But when they were on the clock, the Dolphins didn’t hesitate. </p><p><!-- %asset:147314334% --></p><p>It was Harris over Alabama linebacker Reuben Foster, or Ohio State cornerback Gareon Conley or University of Miami tight end David Njoku.</p><p>No question. No equivocation.</p><p>“He was our guy,” Grier said.</p><p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"147,1,0,24\"> </span>The Dolphins were so, so convinced they actually tried to hide their interest in Harris by kind of ignoring him. They didn’t talk to his agent much. They didn’t let some people within the organization know Harris was the guy.</p><p>As if a Southeastern Conference player who made plays against Tennessee and LSU and Florida was going to be some sort of secret to everyone.</p><div class=\"ng_z_idx_alfa\"><p>But secret or not, the Dolphins get a player who apparently has a wildly colorful excitement about the game and his new team.</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p>“I ain’t never been to Miami, but I’ll make that move,” Harris said late Thursday evening. “Let’s do it!”</p><p>The Dolphins will welcome Harris to their facility for the first time in the next day or so. And pretty soon they’ll be asking him to join the defensive end rotation that includes Cameron Wake, Andre Branch and William Hayes.</p><p><!-- %asset:147311849% --></p><p>Davis says he’ll play standing up. Or with his hands in the dirt. In the Wide Nine. Or whatever the Dolphins dream up for him.</p><p>“Tell me what to do and I will do it,” he said. “I’m going to ball. I’m going to work hard, and I’m going to ball. No doubt about that.”</p><p>That’s great because, well, that’s what he’s <em>supposed</em> to do.</p><p>That’s what a first-round pick is <em>supposed</em> to do.</p><p>Sure, Grier can set the bar low right now, but this kid — all of 22 years old when the football season begins — has a pretty heavy burden on his shoulders now.</p><p>He’s got to be the guy to succeed Cameron Wake. </p><p>And Jason Taylor.</p><p>And Kim Bokamper.</p><p>And Doug Betters.</p><p>And Bill Stanfill.</p><p>He has to be the guy who makes us forget there ever was a Dion Jordan. </p><p><!-- %asset:147295804% --></p><p>Because he is the first-round pick, he can surely be a rotational guy to take snaps from Branch and even Wake this season. But long-term, he has to be the guy that helps ease the sting of the 35-year-old Wake eventually retiring.</p><p>“We love the pass rush he gives us, it’s a position you can never have enough in this league,” Grier said. </p><p>The GM then used terms such as “Gym rat,” and “passionate” and “loves football,” to describe Harris.</p><p>All that is excellent. It’s exciting and comes with the added bonus that it is all true.</p><p>But this is also true:</p><p>At 6-3 and about 255 pounds, Harris is undersized. So he comes with some questions about his run defense and ability to set and anchor on the edge — an issue the Dolphins had trouble resolving when they ranked 30th overall in run defense last season.</p><p>This is how NFL.com draft analyst Lance Zierlein summarizes Harris:</p><p>“High-cut pass rusher with good athleticism but concerns regarding his ability to drop anchor against the run. Ironically, Harris might be best suited as a perpetrator, which is something he fought against this season. His hands can be improved as pass-rush weapons, but he has agility and footwork that can’t be taught. Harris can play on the edge in a 4-3 or 3-4 front and should be the next in a line of early contributing defensive ends coming out of Missouri.”</p><p>The Dolphins don’t mind this. Grier said the Dolphins are “comfortable” with Harris as a run defender.</p><p>“We are,” he said. “He’ll be in the rotation. We envision him being in the top four. Quickness, speed, explosiveness off the edge are what we see in him. He can be a disruptive player.”</p><div class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"><p>Follow Armando Salguero on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArmandoSalguero\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">@ArmandoSalguero</a></p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div></div>",

          "content": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>It’s been 15 consequential years since urban evangelist <a href=\"https://www.creativeclass.com/rfcgdb/articles/Miami%20Herald.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Richard Florida </a>first helped popularize and propel the U.S. urban renaissance with his gospel of the creative class. It held that the tech-consumed, enterprising hip young people flocking back to cities were the nation’s new economic driver, and that luring more of them to every burgh was the key to broad prosperity.</p><p>It turns out that Florida was half-right. And we’re all living with the repercussions.</p><p>If you’re one of the lucky ones, the data-driven precept the rock-star academic defined and prescribed in his book “The Rise of the Creative Class” — a theory adopted by mayors like New York’s Michael Bloomberg and Miami’s Manny Diaz — has worked to a T. </p><p>Young creatives have clustered in once-forlorn neighborhoods from Brooklyn to San Francisco, kicking them back to life with their proclivity for art and artisanal dining, cool bars, authentic architecture, design-savvy loft conversions and, most significantly, for launching innovative start-ups that today draw the whale’s share of U.S. venture-capital investment.</p><p>But it’s no secret that success has been a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">two-headed Hydra </a>for cities. Along with it, Florida acknowledges in a new book that explores the dark side of the urban revival, has come a “staggering” level of social and economic inequality in which winners take all and losers fall farther behind.</p><p>The phenomenon manifests itself in rising housing costs in hot neighborhoods as new urbanites compete for limited places to live and luxury condos replace affordable rentals, pricing out all but the most affluent. The poor and the middle and working classes, meanwhile, are cut off from economic opportunity as they’re pushed out to the margins, accentuating racial and economic segregation, Florida writes in “<a href=\"http://www.creativeclass.com/navbar-included-pages/about-ccg/richard-florida/books-and-writing/books/the-new-urban-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The New Urban Crisis</a>.” </p><p>The result has been the increasingly obvious enclaves of deep economic distress side-by-side with bastions of striking affluence, the shrinking of the middle class and the bitter political resentments that helped elect President Donald Trump.</p><p>The trend doesn’t operate just within individual cities, he says. Wealth, investment, talent, innovation and remunerative jobs are increasingly concentrated in “superstar cities” and tech hubs such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, leaving hollowed-out industrial relics like Akron, Flint and his native Newark at an ever-greater disadvantage. </p><p>“We are two countries,” said Florida, a University of Toronto professor who maintains a winter perch on South Beach, where he wrote much of the book while a fellow at Florida International University’s <a href=\"http://carta.fiu.edu/mbus/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Urban Studios</a>. “We’re too divided. And that’s what really worries me.”</p><p>It’s a crisis comparable in scope, if not in its particulars, to the collapse of cities in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when urban dwellers decamped for the suburbs by the millions, Florida argues. Like its bestselling predecessor, “The New Urban Crisis” is underpinned by reams of data breezily and readably presented, but its conclusions in contrast seem daunting.</p><p>Florida, a whiz at developing metrics with his team at the Toronto school’s <a href=\"http://martinprosperity.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Martin Prosperity Institute</a>, which he leads, came up with an index to rank cities by the gravity of their urban crisis. The metric combines wage and income inequality, economic segregation and housing unaffordability. According to the index, the most successful, booming big cities face the most severe crises — Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, among others.</p><p>Not far behind them, at Number Six? The Miami metro area, which encompasses Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Though South Florida hasn’t seen the sort of tech-related boom or the sky-high housing prices that helped propel its companions onto the crisis list, the Miami metro “suffers from a relatively severe case,” Florida’s team concluded.</p><p>That’s primarily because of its low-wage, service-based economy, in which low-income neighborhoods co-exist with some of the wealthiest communities in the nation, Florida says. Half the Miami metro’s workforce<strong> </strong>is in service employment, a proportion far greater than in other big cities, and many struggle to meet housing costs. </p><p></p><!-- %highline_factoid:1; hidden=\"1\"% --><p>Metro Miami, in fact, ranks second for income inequality on Florida’s list of U.S. cities over 1 million population, putting it on a par internationally with Zimbabwe, and 10th on his ranking by segregation of the wealthy class.</p><p>“It’s terribly, terribly divided,” Florida said.</p><p>Those grim assessments are quite a turnaround for Florida, long the target of critics who complained that his relentlessly upbeat approach ignored precisely the sort of predictable downsides his new book describes. Florida has been promoting the new book and its conclusions at conferences, think tanks and public forums across the country, drawing extensive coverage that sometimes might as well carry a headline saying “Richard Florida repents.” </p><p>If not exactly a <em>mea culpa</em> tour, the circuit and the book reflect a recognition, no matter how belated, that it didn’t all turn out as Florida expected. To be fair, though, Florida has been addressing the inequality issue since at least the revised, 10th anniversary edition of “Rise” in 2012.</p><p>“I think people like honesty, like the fact that I’m honest enough to admit the world changed,” Florida said in an interview. “I took my critics seriously.”</p><p>And his research has now thoroughly persuaded him that the same clustering of talent and enterprise that’s essential to prosperity and the urban revival is also largely to blame for its ugly underside. </p><p>The point of “The New Urban Crisis,” he says, is to diagnose the problem precisely and offer a way past it. The solution, he concludes, lies not in curbing the revival, but in ensuring that more people can share in it. That will mean pushing metro areas and their leaders to adopt a higher minimum wage and expand affordable housing and public transit while allowing denser development in central cities and inner suburbs.</p><p>What hasn’t changed, Florida says, is his conviction that America’s economy depends on the success of its cities.</p><p>“The past decade <em>has</em> been quite successful. The urban revival is great and important. That’s because cities are engines of innovation and economic growth,” Florida said. “But the clustering also causes all kinds of problems. The point is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We don’t need to be gloomy about the urban revival. We need to be wise about it. </p><p></p><!-- %highline_quote:1; hidden=\"1\"% --><p>“I’m trying to make a case, a wake-up call to city leaders and mayors. The next 10 years is about how do we make this inclusive. I don’t have all the answers. I’m an academic. I hope this book shapes the debate.”</p><p>At least one city that embraced Florida’s creative class theory is taking heed. </p><p>At a panel with Florida that drew 500 people earlier this month, Washington, D.C., mayor Muriel Bowser said the capital city benefitted greatly from growth and redevelopment driven in part by his ideas. But in March she unveiled an Agenda for Inclusive Prosperity to spread those benefits to the many who’ve been left out.</p><p>“While we are booming in many ways, we are a city that’s becoming inaccessible to people in many ways,” she said, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2017/04/17/as-the-creative-class-divides-america-its-inventor-richard-florida-reconsiders/?utm_term=.5a9aed0bc46e\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p><p>Florida also hopes to bring his expertise to bear to help boost the fortunes of his winter home. The Knight Foundation announced this month that it’s putting $<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article142754294.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">1.2 million into a joint project </a>by FIU and Florida’s Creative Class Group, a private consultancy, that will conduct extensive research and devise strategies to tackle the city’s economic deficiencies. </p><p>The Miami Future Urban Initiative, to be based at Mana Wynwood, will issue quarterly reports and convene public meetings to discuss findings and recommendations, said Matt Haggman, Knight’s Miami program director.</p><p>“The assumptions we have about Miami are often not true. The city is changing so much,” Haggman said. Having someone who can really shine a light and help us think in new ways will be really, really helpful.”</p><p>Florida said Miami has lots going for it beyond tourism — a growing notice among global cities, an expanding medical field, a big media, music and entertaintment industry catering to Latin America, a growing number of corporate headquarters for companies doing business in Latin America, and a steady flow of immigrants who supply the city with a significant number of its creatives and college graduates.</p><p>But it’s also economically hamstrung by its relatively small middle class and its lack of public transit, he said.</p><p>“If you don’t get transportation right, you can’t scale (up). You’re going to be stuck,” Florida said. “We keep punting on this stuff. But it <em>is</em> a crisis. </p><p></p><!-- %highline_quote:2; hidden=\"1\"% --><p>“There is stuff to build on. We just haven’t had a robust set of conversations. I hope with this effort to change that. We need to embrace our role as a global city.”</p><p>But if Trump — whom Florida detests — makes good on his promise to go after immigrants, Florida said, Miami could be in big trouble. Given Trump’s hostility to cities, he argues, his presidency could presage a dark period for cities, which depend heavily on federal assistance for affordable housing and transportation.</p><p>Trump’s surprising election prompted a last-minute rewrite of portions of Florida’s new book, which had assumed new urban-fiendly initiatives by a Hillary Clinton administration, to incorporate what may be its most radical recommendation: “Devolution,” meaning the redirection of power, decision-making authority and funding from the federal government to mayors and cities.</p><p>That’s something both liberals and conservatives could agree on, Florida says. And it could be the only way forward for cities to overcome a new age of crisis.</p><p>“It was a big ‘aha’ for me,” Florida said. “We’re not going to get federal money. We’re going to have to figure out a way to make it happen on our own.”</p><div class=\"ng_factbox\"><div class=\"ng_factbox_head\"><p>URBAN CRISIS INDEX</p><span class=\"ng-command\" data-value=\"252\"> </span></div><p>The following table ranks large metro areas according to their Urban Crisis Index scores.
